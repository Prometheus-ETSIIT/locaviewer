Chapter 1 Overview of MySQL Connector/J

   MySQL provides connectivity for client applications developed in
   the Java programming language with MySQL Connector/J, a driver
   that implements the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API
   (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/jdbc/index.html).

   MySQL Connector/J is a JDBC Type 4 driver. Different versions are
   available that are compatible with the JDBC 3.0
   (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/jdbc/) and JDBC
   4.0 (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jdbc/)
   specifications (see Chapter 2, "Connector/J Versions"). The Type 4
   designation means that the driver is a pure Java implementation of
   the MySQL protocol and does not rely on the MySQL client
   libraries.

   For large-scale programs that use common design patterns of data
   access, consider using one of the popular persistence frameworks
   such as Hibernate (http://www.hibernate.org/), Spring's JDBC
   templates (http://www.springframework.org/) or Ibatis SQL Maps
   (http://ibatis.apache.org/) to reduce the amount of JDBC code for
   you to debug, tune, secure, and maintain.

Key Topics


     * For help with connection strings, connection options, and
       setting up your connection through JDBC, see Section 5.1,
       "Driver/Datasource Class Names, URL Syntax and Configuration
       Properties for Connector/J."

Chapter 2 Connector/J Versions

   There are currently four versions of MySQL Connector/J available:

     * Connector/J 5.1 is the Type 4 pure Java JDBC driver, which
       conforms to the JDBC 3.0 and JDBC 4.0 specifications. It
       provides compatibility with all the functionality of MySQL,
       including 4.1, 5.0, 5.1, 5.5, 5.6, and 5.7. Connector/J 5.1
       provides ease of development features, including
       auto-registration with the Driver Manager, standardized
       validity checks, categorized SQLExceptions, support for the
       JDBC-4.0 XML processing, per connection client information,
       NCHAR (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/char.html),
       NVARCHAR (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/char.html)
       and NCLOB types. This release also includes all bug fixes up
       to and including Connector/J 5.0.6.

     * Connector/J 5.0 provides support for all the functionality
       offered by Connector/J 3.1 and includes distributed
       transaction (XA) support.

     * Connector/J 3.1 was designed for connectivity to MySQL 4.1 and
       MySQL 5.0 servers and provides support for all the
       functionality in MySQL 5.0 except distributed transaction (XA)
       support.

     * Connector/J 3.0 provides core functionality and was designed
       for connectivity to MySQL 3.x or MySQL 4.1 servers, although
       it provides basic compatibility with later versions of MySQL.
       Connector/J 3.0 does not support server-side prepared
       statements, and does not support any of the features in
       versions of MySQL later than 4.1.

   The following table summarizes the Connector/J versions available,
   along with the details of JDBC driver type, what version of the
   JDBC API it supports, what versions of MySQL Server it works with,
   and whether it is currently supported or not:

   Table 2.1 Summary of Connector/J Versions
   Connector/J version Driver Type JDBC version MySQL Server version
   Status
   5.1 4 3.0, 4.0 4.1, 5.0, 5.1, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7 Recommended version
   5.0 4 3.0 4.1, 5.0 Released version
   3.1 4 3.0 4.1, 5.0 Obsolete
   3.0 4 3.0 3.x, 4.1 Obsolete

   The current recommended version for Connector/J is 5.1. This guide
   covers all four connector versions, with specific notes given
   where a setting applies to a specific option.

2.1 Connector/J Release Notes and Change History

   For details of new features and bug fixes in each Connector/J
   release, see the MySQL Connector/J Release Notes
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/connector-j/en/).

2.2 Java Versions Supported

   The following table summarizes what version of Java RTE is
   required to use Connector/J with Java applications, and what
   version of JDK is required to build Connector/J source code:

   Table 2.2 Summary of Java Versions Required by Connector/J
   Connector/J version Java RTE required JDK required (to build
   source code)
   5.1 1.5.x, 1.6.x, 1.7.x 1.6.x and 1.5.x
   5.0 1.3.x, 1.4.x, 1.5.x, 1.6.x 1.4.2, 1.5.x, 1.6.x
   3.1 1.2.x, 1.3.x, 1.4.x, 1.5.x, 1.6.x 1.4.2, 1.5.x, 1.6.x
   3.0 1.2.x, 1.3.x, 1.4.x, 1.5.x, 1.6.x 1.4.2, 1.5.x, 1.6.x

   If you are building Connector/J from source code using the source
   distribution (see Section 3.4, "Installing from the Development
   Source Tree"), you must use JDK 1.4.2 or newer to compile the
   package for Connector/J 5.0 or earlier. For Connector/J 5.1, you
   must have both JDK-1.6.x AND JDK-1.5.x installed to be able to
   build the source code.

   Java 1.7 support requires Connector/J 5.1.21 and higher. Several
   JDBC 4.1 methods were implemented for the first time in
   Connector/J 5.1.21.

   Because of the implementation of java.sql.Savepoint, Connector/J
   3.1.0 and newer will not run on a Java runtime older than 1.4
   unless the class verifier is turned off (by setting the
   -Xverify:none option to the Java runtime). This is because the
   class verifier will try to load the class definition for
   java.sql.Savepoint even though it is not accessed by the driver
   unless you actually use savepoint functionality.

   Caching functionality provided by Connector/J 3.1.0 or newer is
   also not available on JVMs older than 1.4.x, as it relies on
   java.util.LinkedHashMap which was first available in JDK-1.4.0.

   MySQL Connector/J does not support JDK-1.1.x or JDK-1.0.x.

Chapter 3 Connector/J Installation

   You can install the Connector/J package using either the binary or
   source distribution. The binary distribution provides the easiest
   method for installation; the source distribution lets you
   customize your installation further. With either solution, you
   manually add the Connector/J location to your Java CLASSPATH.

   If you are upgrading from a previous version, read the upgrade
   information in Section 3.3, "Upgrading from an Older Version"
   before continuing.

   Connector/J is also available as part of the Maven project. For
   more information, and to download the Connector/J JAR files, see
   the Maven repository (http://www.ibiblio.org/maven/).

3.1 Installing Connector/J from a Binary Distribution

   For the easiest method of installation, use the binary
   distribution of the Connector/J package. The binary distribution
   is available either as a tar/gzip or zip file. Extract it to a
   suitable location, then optionally make the information about the
   package available by changing your CLASSPATH (see Section 3.2,
   "Installing the Driver and Configuring the CLASSPATH").

   MySQL Connector/J is distributed as a .zip or .tar.gz archive
   containing the sources, the class files, and the JAR archive named
   mysql-connector-java-version-bin.jar.

   Starting with Connector/J 3.1.9, the .class files that constitute
   the JAR files are only included as part of the driver JAR file.

   Starting with Connector/J 3.1.8, the archive also includes a debug
   build of the driver in a file named
   mysql-connector-java-version-bin-g.jar. Do not use the debug build
   of the driver unless instructed to do so when reporting a problem
   or a bug, as it is not designed to be run in production
   environments, and will have adverse performance impact when used.
   The debug binary also depends on the Aspect/J runtime library,
   which is located in the src/lib/aspectjrt.jar file that comes with
   the Connector/J distribution.

   Use the appropriate graphical or command-line utility to extract
   the distribution (for example, WinZip for the .zip archive, and
   tar for the .tar.gz archive). Because there are potentially long
   file names in the distribution, we use the GNU tar archive format.
   Use GNU tar (or an application that understands the GNU tar
   archive format) to unpack the .tar.gz variant of the distribution.

3.2 Installing the Driver and Configuring the CLASSPATH

   Once you have extracted the distribution archive, you can install
   the driver by placing mysql-connector-java-version-bin.jar in your
   classpath, either by adding the full path to it to your CLASSPATH
   environment variable, or by directly specifying it with the
   command line switch -cp when starting the JVM.

   To use the driver with the JDBC DriverManager, use
   com.mysql.jdbc.Driver as the class that implements
   java.sql.Driver.

   You can set the CLASSPATH environment variable under Unix, Linux
   or Mac OS X either locally for a user within their .profile,
   .login or other login file. You can also set it globally by
   editing the global /etc/profile file.

   For example, add the Connector/J driver to your CLASSPATH using
   one of the following forms, depending on your command shell:
# Bourne-compatible shell (sh, ksh, bash, zsh):
shell> export CLASSPATH=/path/mysql-connector-java-ver-bin.jar:$CLASS
PATH

# C shell (csh, tcsh):
shell> setenv CLASSPATH /path/mysql-connector-java-ver-bin.jar:$CLASS
PATH

   Within Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Windows
   Vista, you set the environment variable through the System Control
   Panel.

   To use MySQL Connector/J with an application server such as
   GlassFish, Tomcat, or JBoss, read your vendor's documentation for
   more information on how to configure third-party class libraries,
   as most application servers ignore the CLASSPATH environment
   variable. For configuration examples for some J2EE application
   servers, see Chapter 7, "Connection Pooling with Connector/J"
   Section 8.1, "Configuring Load Balancing with Connector/J," and
   Section 8.2, "Configuring Failover with Connector/J." However, the
   authoritative source for JDBC connection pool configuration
   information for your particular application server is the
   documentation for that application server.

   If you are developing servlets or JSPs, and your application
   server is J2EE-compliant, you can put the driver's .jar file in
   the WEB-INF/lib subdirectory of your webapp, as this is a standard
   location for third party class libraries in J2EE web applications.

   You can also use the MysqlDataSource or
   MysqlConnectionPoolDataSource classes in the
   com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional package, if your J2EE application
   server supports or requires them. Starting with Connector/J 5.0.0,
   the javax.sql.XADataSource interface is implemented using the
   com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlXADataSource class, which
   supports XA distributed transactions when used in combination with
   MySQL server version 5.0.

   The various MysqlDataSource classes support the following
   parameters (through standard set mutators):

     * user

     * password

     * serverName (see the previous section about fail-over hosts)

     * databaseName

     * port

3.3 Upgrading from an Older Version

   This section has information for users who are upgrading from one
   version of Connector/J to another, or to a new version of the
   MySQL server that supports a more recent level of JDBC. A newer
   version of Connector/J might include changes to support new
   features, improve existing functionality, or comply with new
   standards.

3.3.1 Upgrading to MySQL Connector/J 5.1.x


     * In Connector/J 5.0.x and earlier, the alias for a table in a
       SELECT (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/select.html)
       statement is returned when accessing the result set metadata
       using ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName(). This behavior however
       is not JDBC compliant, and in Connector/J 5.1 this behavior
       was changed so that the original table name, rather than the
       alias, is returned.
       The JDBC-compliant behavior is designed to let API users
       reconstruct the DML statement based on the metadata within
       ResultSet and ResultSetMetaData.
       You can get the alias for a column in a result set by calling
       ResultSetMetaData.getColumnLabel(). To use the old
       noncompliant behavior with ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName(),
       use the useOldAliasMetadataBehavior option and set the value
       to true.
       In Connector/J 5.0.x, the default value of
       useOldAliasMetadataBehavior was true, but in Connector/J 5.1
       this was changed to a default value of false.

3.3.2 JDBC-Specific Issues When Upgrading to MySQL Server 4.1 or
Newer


     * Using the UTF-8 Character Encoding - Prior to MySQL server
       version 4.1, the UTF-8 character encoding was not supported by
       the server, however the JDBC driver could use it, allowing
       storage of multiple character sets in latin1 tables on the
       server.
       Starting with MySQL-4.1, this functionality is deprecated. If
       you have applications that rely on this functionality, and can
       not upgrade them to use the official Unicode character support
       in MySQL server version 4.1 or newer, add the following
       property to your connection URL:
       useOldUTF8Behavior=true

     * Server-side Prepared Statements - Connector/J 3.1 will
       automatically detect and use server-side prepared statements
       when they are available (MySQL server version 4.1.0 and
       newer). If your application encounters issues with server-side
       prepared statements, you can revert to the older client-side
       emulated prepared statement code that is still presently used
       for MySQL servers older than 4.1.0 with the following
       connection property:
       useServerPrepStmts=false

3.3.3 Upgrading from MySQL Connector/J 3.0 to 3.1

   Connector/J 3.1 is designed to be backward-compatible with
   Connector/J 3.0 as much as possible. Major changes are isolated to
   new functionality exposed in MySQL-4.1 and newer, which includes
   Unicode character sets, server-side prepared statements, SQLState
   codes returned in error messages by the server and various
   performance enhancements that can be enabled or disabled using
   configuration properties.

     * Unicode Character Sets: See the next section, as well as
       Character Set Support
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/charset.html), for
       information on this MySQL feature. If you have something
       misconfigured, it will usually show up as an error with a
       message similar to Illegal mix of collations.

     * Server-side Prepared Statements: Connector/J 3.1 will
       automatically detect and use server-side prepared statements
       when they are available (MySQL server version 4.1.0 and
       newer).
       Starting with version 3.1.7, the driver scans SQL you are
       preparing using all variants of Connection.prepareStatement()
       to determine if it is a supported type of statement to prepare
       on the server side, and if it is not supported by the server,
       it instead prepares it as a client-side emulated prepared
       statement. You can disable this feature by passing
       emulateUnsupportedPstmts=false in your JDBC URL.
       If your application encounters issues with server-side
       prepared statements, you can revert to the older client-side
       emulated prepared statement code that is still presently used
       for MySQL servers older than 4.1.0 with the connection
       property useServerPrepStmts=false.

     * Datetimes with all-zero components (0000-00-00 ...): These
       values cannot be represented reliably in Java. Connector/J
       3.0.x always converted them to NULL when being read from a
       ResultSet.
       Connector/J 3.1 throws an exception by default when these
       values are encountered, as this is the most correct behavior
       according to the JDBC and SQL standards. This behavior can be
       modified using the zeroDateTimeBehavior configuration
       property. The permissible values are:

          + exception (the default), which throws an SQLException
            with an SQLState of S1009.

          + convertToNull, which returns NULL instead of the date.

          + round, which rounds the date to the nearest closest value
            which is 0001-01-01.
       Starting with Connector/J 3.1.7, ResultSet.getString() can be
       decoupled from this behavior using noDatetimeStringSync=true
       (the default value is false) so that you can retrieve the
       unaltered all-zero value as a String. Note that this also
       precludes using any time zone conversions, therefore the
       driver will not allow you to enable noDatetimeStringSync and
       useTimezone at the same time.

     * New SQLState Codes: Connector/J 3.1 uses SQL:1999 SQLState
       codes returned by the MySQL server (if supported), which are
       different from the legacy X/Open state codes that Connector/J
       3.0 uses. If connected to a MySQL server older than
       MySQL-4.1.0 (the oldest version to return SQLStates as part of
       the error code), the driver will use a built-in mapping. You
       can revert to the old mapping by using the configuration
       property useSqlStateCodes=false.

     * ResultSet.getString(): Calling ResultSet.getString() on a BLOB
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/blob.html) column will
       now return the address of the byte[] array that represents it,
       instead of a String representation of the BLOB
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/blob.html). BLOB
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/blob.html) values have
       no character set, so they cannot be converted to
       java.lang.Strings without data loss or corruption.
       To store strings in MySQL with LOB behavior, use one of the
       TEXT (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/blob.html) types,
       which the driver will treat as a java.sql.Clob.

     * Debug builds: Starting with Connector/J 3.1.8 a debug build of
       the driver in a file named
       mysql-connector-java-version-bin-g.jar is shipped alongside
       the normal binary jar file that is named
       mysql-connector-java-version-bin.jar.
       Starting with Connector/J 3.1.9, we do not ship the .class
       files unbundled, they are only available in the JAR archives
       that ship with the driver.
       Do not use the debug build of the driver unless instructed to
       do so when reporting a problem or bug, as it is not designed
       to be run in production environments, and will have adverse
       performance impact when used. The debug binary also depends on
       the Aspect/J runtime library, which is located in the
       src/lib/aspectjrt.jar file that comes with the Connector/J
       distribution.

3.4 Installing from the Development Source Tree

   Caution

   Read this section only if you are interested in helping us test
   our new code. To just get MySQL Connector/J up and running on your
   system, use a standard binary release distribution.

   To install MySQL Connector/J from the development source tree,
   make sure that you have the following software on your system:

     * A Bazaar client, to check out the sources from our Launchpad
       repository (available from http://bazaar-vcs.org/).

     * Apache Ant version 1.7 or newer (available from
       http://ant.apache.org/).

     * JDK 1.4.2 or later for building Connector/J 5.0 or earlier,
       JDK 1.6.x AND JDK 1.5.x for building Connector/J 5.1. Refer to
       Section 2.2, "Java Versions Supported" for the version of Java
       you need to build or run any Connector/J release.

     * The Ant Contrib (version 1.03b is available from
       http://sourceforge.net/projects/ant-contrib/files/ant-contrib/
       1.0b3/) and Junit (available from
       https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Download-and-Install)
       libraries.


     * The required jar files from the Hibernate ORM 4.1.12 Final
       release bundle, which is available at
       http://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate4/.

   To check out and compile a specific branch of MySQL Connector/J,
   follow these steps:

    1. Check out the latest code from the branch that you want with
       one of the following commands.
       The source code repository for MySQL Connector/J is located on
       Launchpad at https://code.launchpad.net/connectorj. To check
       out the latest development branch, use:
shell> bzr branch lp:connectorj
       This creates a connectorj subdirectory in the current
       directory that contains the latest sources for the requested
       branch.
       To check out the latest 5.1 code, use:
shell> bzr branch lp:connectorj/5.1
       This creates a 5.1 subdirectory in the current directory
       containing the latest 5.1 code.

    2. To build Connector/J 5.1, make sure that you have both JDK
       1.6.x AND JDK 1.5.x installed. You need both JDKs because
       Connector/J 5.1 supports both JDBC 3.0 (which has existed
       prior to JDK 1.6.x) and JDBC 4.0. Set your JAVA_HOME
       environment variable to the path to the JDK 1.5.x
       installation.

    3. Place the required ant-contrib.jar file (in exactly that name,
       without the version number in it; rename the jar file if
       needed) and junit.jar file in a separate directory---for
       example, /home/username/ant-extralibs.

    4. In the same directory for extra libraries described in the
       last step, create a directory named hibernate4, and put under
       it all the jar files you can find under the /lib/required/
       folder in the Hibernate ORM 4.1.2 Final release bundle.

    5. Change your current working directory to either the connectorj
       or 5.1 directory, depending on which branch you intend to
       build.

    6. In the directory, create a file named build.properties to
       indicate to Ant the locations of the Javac and rt.jar of your
       JDK 1.6.x, as well as the location of the extra libraries. The
       file should contain the following property settings, with the
       "path_to_" parts replaced by the appropriate filepaths:
com.mysql.jdbc.java6.javac=path_to_javac_1.6/javac
com.mysql.jdbc.java6.rtjar=path_to_rt.jar_under_jdk_1.6/rt.jar
com.mysql.jdbc.extra.libs=path_to_folder_for_extra_libraries
       Alternatively, you can set the values of those properties
       through the Ant -D options.

    7. Issue the following command to compile the driver and create a
       .jar file suitable for installation:
shell> ant dist
       This creates a build directory in the current directory, where
       all build output will go. A directory is created in the build
       directory that includes the version number of the sources you
       are building from. This directory contains the sources,
       compiled .class files, and a .jar file suitable for
       deployment. For other possible targets, including those that
       create a fully packaged distribution, issue the following
       command:
shell> ant -projecthelp

    8. A newly created .jar file containing the JDBC driver will be
       placed in the directory build/mysql-connector-java-version.
       Install the newly created JDBC driver as you would install a
       binary .jar file you download from MySQL by following the
       instructions given in Section 3.2, "Installing the Driver and
       Configuring the CLASSPATH."

   A package containing both the binary and source code for
   Connector/J 5.1 can also be found at the following location:

Chapter 5 Connector/J (JDBC) Reference

   This section of the manual contains reference material for MySQL
   Connector/J.

5.1 Driver/Datasource Class Names, URL Syntax and Configuration
Properties for Connector/J

   The name of the class that implements java.sql.Driver in MySQL
   Connector/J is com.mysql.jdbc.Driver. The org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver
   class name is also usable for backward compatibility with
   MM.MySQL, the predecessor of Connector/J. Use this class name when
   registering the driver, or when otherwise configuring software to
   use MySQL Connector/J.

JDBC URL Format

   The JDBC URL format for MySQL Connector/J is as follows, with
   items in square brackets ([, ]) being optional:
jdbc:mysql://[host][,failoverhost...][:port]/[database] ??
[?propertyName1][=propertyValue1][&propertyName2][=propertyValue2]...

   If the host name is not specified, it defaults to 127.0.0.1. If
   the port is not specified, it defaults to 3306, the default port
   number for MySQL servers.
jdbc:mysql://[host:port],[host:port].../[database] ??
[?propertyName1][=propertyValue1][&propertyName2][=propertyValue2]...

   Here is a sample connection URL:
jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/sakila?profileSQL=true

IPv6 Connections

   For IPv6 connections, use this alternative syntax to specify hosts
   in the URL, address=(key=value). Supported keys are:

     * (protocol=tcp), or (protocol=pipe) for named pipes on Windows.

     * (path=path_to_pipe) for named pipes.

     * (host=hostname) for TCP connections.

     * (port=port_number) for TCP connections.

   For example:
jdbc:mysql://address=(protocol=tcp)(host=localhost)(port=3306)(user=t
est)/db

   Any other parameters are treated as host-specific properties that
   follow the conventions of the JDBC URL properties. This now allows
   per-host overrides of any configuration property for multi-host
   connections (that is, when using failover, load balancing, or
   replication). Limit the overrides to user, password, network
   timeouts and statement and metadata cache sizes; the results of
   other per-host overrides are not defined.

Initial Database for Connection

   If the database is not specified, the connection is made with no
   default database. In this case, either call the setCatalog()
   method on the Connection instance, or fully specify table names
   using the database name (that is, SELECT dbname.tablename.colname
   FROM dbname.tablename...) in your SQL. Opening a connection
   without specifying the database to use is generally only useful
   when building tools that work with multiple databases, such as GUI
   database managers.
   Note

   Always use the Connection.setCatalog() method to specify the
   desired database in JDBC applications, rather than the USE
   database statement.

Failover Support

   MySQL Connector/J has failover support. This enables the driver to
   fail over to any number of slave hosts and still perform read-only
   queries. Failover only happens when the connection is in an
   autoCommit(true) state, because failover cannot happen reliably
   when a transaction
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/glossary.html#glos_transac
   tion) is in progress. Most application servers and connection
   pools set autoCommit to true at the end of every
   transaction/connection use.

   The failover functionality has the following behavior:

     * If the URL property autoReconnect is false: Failover only
       happens at connection initialization, and failback occurs when
       the driver determines that the first host has become available
       again.

     * If the URL property autoReconnect is true: Failover happens
       when the driver determines that the connection has failed
       (checked before every query), and falls back to the first host
       when it determines that the host has become available again
       (after queriesBeforeRetryMaster queries have been issued).

   In either case, whenever you are connected to a "failed-over"
   server, the connection is set to read-only state, so queries that
   attempt to modify data will throw exceptions (the query will never
   be processed by the MySQL server).

Setting Configuration Properties

   Configuration properties define how Connector/J will make a
   connection to a MySQL server. Unless otherwise noted, properties
   can be set for a DataSource object or for a Connection object.

   Configuration properties can be set in one of the following ways:

     * Using the set*() methods on MySQL implementations of
       java.sql.DataSource (which is the preferred method when using
       implementations of java.sql.DataSource):

          + com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlDataSource

          + com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlConnectionPoolDataSour
            ce

     * As a key/value pair in the java.util.Properties instance
       passed to DriverManager.getConnection() or Driver.connect()

     * As a JDBC URL parameter in the URL given to
       java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(),
       java.sql.Driver.connect() or the MySQL implementations of the
       javax.sql.DataSource setURL() method.
       Note
       If the mechanism you use to configure a JDBC URL is XML-based,
       use the XML character literal &amp; to separate configuration
       parameters, as the ampersand is a reserved character for XML.

   The properties are listed in the following tables.

   Connection/Authentication.

   value of system variable 'max_allowed_packet' will be used to
   initialize this upon connecting. This value will not take effect
   if set larger than the value of 'max_allowed_packet'. Also, due to
   an internal dependency with the property "blobSendChunkSize", this
   setting has a minimum value of "8203" if "useServerPrepStmts" is
   set to "true".

   Default: -1

   Since version: 5.1.8

   Since version: 5.0.7

   High Availability and Clustering. 
   Properties and Descriptions

   autoReconnect

   Should the driver try to re-establish stale and/or dead
   connections? If enabled the driver will throw an exception for a
   queries issued on a stale or dead connection, which belong to the
   current transaction, but will attempt reconnect before the next
   query issued on the connection in a new transaction. The use of
   this feature is not recommended, because it has side effects
   related to session state and data consistency when applications
   don't handle SQLExceptions properly, and is only designed to be
   used when you are unable to configure your application to handle
   SQLExceptions resulting from dead and stale connections properly.
   Alternatively, as a last option, investigate setting the MySQL
   server variable "wait_timeout" to a high value, rather than the
   default of 8 hours.

   If autoReconnect is set to true, should the driver attempt
   reconnections at the end of every transaction?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.0.10

   retriesAllDown

   When using loadbalancing, the number of times the driver should
   cycle through available hosts, attempting to connect. Between

   Since version: 5.1.6

   initialTimeout

   If autoReconnect is enabled, the initial time to wait between
   re-connect attempts (in seconds, defaults to '2').

   Default: 2

   Since version: 1.1

   roundRobinLoadBalance

   When autoReconnect is enabled, and failoverReadonly is false,
   should we pick hosts to connect to on a round-robin basis?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.2

   queriesBeforeRetryMaster

   Number of queries to issue before falling back to master when
   failed over (when using multi-host failover). Whichever condition
   is met first, 'queriesBeforeRetryMaster' or

   reconnect to the master. Defaults to 50.

   Default: 50

   Since version: 3.0.2

   secondsBeforeRetryMaster

   How long should the driver wait, when failed over, before
   attempting

   Since version: 3.0.2

   allowMasterDownConnections

   Should replication-aware driver establish connections to slaves
   when connection to master servers cannot be established at initial
   connection? Defaults to 'false', which will cause SQLException
   when configured master hosts are all unavailable when establishing
   a new replication-aware Connection.

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.1.27

   replicationEnableJMX

   Enables JMX-based management of load-balanced connection groups,

   exceeds this value.

   Default: 0

   Since version: 5.1.6

   resourceId

   A globally unique name that identifies the resource that this
   datasource or connection is connected to, used for
   XAResource.isSameRM() when the driver can't determine this value
   based on hostnames used in the URL

   Since version: 5.0.1

   Security. 
   Properties and Descriptions

   allowMultiQueries

   Allow the use of ';' to delimit multiple queries during one
   statement (true/false), defaults to 'false', and does not affect
   the addBatch() and executeBatch() methods, which instead rely on
   rewriteBatchStatements.

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.1

   useSSL

   Use SSL when communicating with the server (true/false), defaults

   Since version: 3.1.0

   verifyServerCertificate

   If "useSSL" is set to "true", should the driver verify the
   server's certificate? When using this feature, the keystore
   parameters should be specified by the "clientCertificateKeyStore*"
   properties, rather than system properties.

   Allows special handshake roundtrip to get server RSA public key
   directly from server.

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.1.31

   paranoid

   messages and clear data structures holding sensitive data when
   possible? (defaults to 'false')

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.0.1

   passwordCharacterEncoding

   What character encoding is used for passwords? Leaving this set to
   the default value (null), uses the platform character set, which
   works for ISO8859_1 (i.e. "latin1") passwords. For passwords in
   other character encodings, the encoding will have to be specified
   with this property, as it's not possible for the driver to
   auto-detect this.

   Since version: 5.1.7

   serverRSAPublicKeyFile

   File path to the server RSA public key file for sha256_password
   authentication. If not specified, the public key will be retrieved

   Since version: 3.1.2

   metadataCacheSize

   The number of queries to cache ResultSetMetadata for if
   cacheResultSetMetaData is set to 'true' (default 50)

   Default: 50

   Since version: 3.1.1

   useLocalSessionState

   Should the driver refer to the internal values of autocommit and
   transaction isolation that are set by Connection.setAutoCommit()
   and Connection.setTransactionIsolation() and transaction state as
   maintained by the protocol, rather than querying the database or
   blindly sending commands to the database for commit() or
   rollback() method calls?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.7

   useLocalTransactionState

   Should the driver use the in-transaction state provided by the
   MySQL protocol to determine if a commit() or rollback() should
   actually be sent to the database?

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.1.7

   prepStmtCacheSize

   If prepared statement caching is enabled, how many prepared
   statements should be cached?

   serverConfigCacheFactory

   Name of a class implementing
   com.mysql.jdbc.CacheAdapterFactory<String, Map<String, String>>,
   which will be used to create caches for MySQL server configuration
   values

   Default: com.mysql.jdbc.PerVmServerConfigCacheFactory

   Since version: 5.1.1

   alwaysSendSetIsolation

   Should the driver always communicate with the database when
   Connection.setTransactionIsolation() is called? If set to false,
   the driver will only communicate with the database when the
   requested transaction isolation is different than the whichever is
   newer, the last value that was set via
   Connection.setTransactionIsolation(), or the value that was read
   from the server when the connection was established. Note that
   useLocalSessionState=true will force the same behavior as
   alwaysSendSetIsolation=false, regardless of how
   alwaysSendSetIsolation is set.

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.1.7

   maintainTimeStats

   Should the driver maintain various internal timers to enable idle
   time calculations as well as more verbose error messages when the
   connection to the server fails? Setting this property to false
   removes at least two calls to System.getCurrentTimeMillis() per
   query.

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.1.9

   useCursorFetch

   If connected to MySQL > 5.0.2, and setFetchSize() > 0 on a

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.0.0

   blobSendChunkSize

   Chunk size to use when sending BLOB/CLOBs via
   ServerPreparedStatements. Note that this value cannot exceed the

   Default: 1048576

   Since version: 3.1.9

   cacheCallableStmts

   Should the driver cache the parsing stage of CallableStatements

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.2

   cachePrepStmts

   Should the driver cache the parsing stage of PreparedStatements of
   client-side prepared statements, the "check" for suitability of
   server-side prepared and server-side prepared statements
   themselves?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.0.10

   cacheResultSetMetadata

   Should the driver cache ResultSetMetaData for Statements and
   PreparedStatements? (Req. JDK-1.4+, true/false, default 'false')

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.1

   cacheServerConfiguration

   Should the driver cache the results of 'SHOW VARIABLES' and 'SHOW
   COLLATION' on a per-URL basis?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.5

   defaultFetchSize

   The driver will call setFetchSize(n) with this value on all
   newly-created Statements

   Default: 0

   Since version: 3.1.9

   dontCheckOnDuplicateKeyUpdateInSQL

   Stops checking if every INSERT statement contains the "ON
   DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE" clause. As a side effect, obtaining the
   statement's generated keys information will return a list where
   normally it wouldn't. Also be aware that, in this case, the list
   of generated keys returned may not be accurate. The effect of this
   property is canceled if set simultaneously with
   'rewriteBatchedStatements=true'.

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.1.32

   dontTrackOpenResources

   The JDBC specification requires the driver to automatically track
   and close resources, however if your application doesn't do a good
   job of explicitly calling close() on statements or result sets,
   this can cause memory leakage. Setting this property to true
   relaxes this constraint, and can be more memory efficient for some
   applications. Also the automatic closing of the Statement and
   current ResultSet in Statement.closeOnCompletion() and
   Statement.getMoreResults ([Statement.CLOSE_CURRENT_RESULT |
   Statement.CLOSE_ALL_RESULTS]), respectively, ceases to happen.
   This property automatically sets
   holdResultsOpenOverStatementClose=true.

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.7

   dynamicCalendars

   Should the driver retrieve the default calendar when required, or
   cache it per connection/session?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.5

   elideSetAutoCommits

   If using MySQL-4.1 or newer, should the driver only issue 'set
   autocommit=n' queries when the server's state doesn't match the
   requested state by Connection.setAutoCommit(boolean)?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.3

   enableQueryTimeouts

   When enabled, query timeouts set via Statement.setQueryTimeout()
   use a shared java.util.Timer instance for scheduling. Even if the
   timeout doesn't expire before the query is processed, there will
   be memory used by the TimerTask for the given timeout which won't
   be reclaimed until the time the timeout would have expired if it
   hadn't been cancelled by the driver. High-load environments might
   want to consider disabling this functionality.

   Default: true

   Since version: 5.0.6

   holdResultsOpenOverStatementClose

   Should the driver close result sets on Statement.close() as
   required by the JDBC specification?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.7

   largeRowSizeThreshold

   What size result set row should the JDBC driver consider "large",
   and thus use a more memory-efficient way of representing the row
   internally?

   Default: 2048

   Since version: 5.1.1

   loadBalanceStrategy

   If using a load-balanced connection to connect to SQL nodes in a
   MySQL Cluster/NDB configuration (by using the URL prefix
   "jdbc:mysql:loadbalance://"), which load balancing algorithm
   should the driver use: (1) "random" - the driver will pick a
   random host for each request. This tends to work better than
   round-robin, as the randomness will somewhat account for spreading
   loads where requests vary in response time, while round-robin can
   sometimes lead to overloaded nodes if there are variations in
   response times across the workload. (2) "bestResponseTime" - the
   driver will route the request to the host that had the best
   response time for the previous transaction.

   Default: random

   Since version: 5.0.6

   locatorFetchBufferSize

   If 'emulateLocators' is configured to 'true', what size buffer
   should be used when fetching BLOB data for getBinaryInputStream?

   Default: 1048576

   Since version: 3.2.1

   rewriteBatchedStatements

   Should the driver use multiqueries (irregardless of the setting of
   "allowMultiQueries") as well as rewriting of prepared statements
   for INSERT into multi-value inserts when executeBatch() is called?
   Notice that this has the potential for SQL injection if using
   plain java.sql.Statements and your code doesn't sanitize input
   correctly. Notice that for prepared statements, server-side
   prepared statements can not currently take advantage of this
   rewrite option, and that if you don't specify stream lengths when
   using PreparedStatement.set*Stream(), the driver won't be able to
   determine the optimum number of parameters per batch and you might
   receive an error from the driver that the resultant packet is too
   large. Statement.getGeneratedKeys() for these rewritten statements
   only works when the entire batch includes INSERT statements.
   Please be aware using rewriteBatchedStatements=true with INSERT ..
   ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE that for rewritten statement server
   returns only one value as sum of all affected (or found) rows in
   batch and it isn't possible to map it correctly to initial
   statements; in this case driver returns 0 as a result of each
   batch statement if total count was 0, and the
   Statement.SUCCESS_NO_INFO as a result of each batch statement if
   total count was > 0.

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.13

   useDirectRowUnpack

   Use newer result set row unpacking code that skips a copy from
   network buffers to a MySQL packet instance and instead reads
   directly into the result set row data buffers.

   Default: true

   Since version: 5.1.1

   useDynamicCharsetInfo

   Should the driver use a per-connection cache of character set
   information queried from the server when necessary, or use a
   built-in static mapping that is more efficient, but isn't aware of
   custom character sets or character sets implemented after the
   release of the JDBC driver?

   Default: true

   Since version: 5.0.6

   useFastDateParsing

   Use internal String->Integer conversion routines to avoid
   excessive object creation?

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.1.4

   Since version: 5.0.1

   useReadAheadInput

   Use newer, optimized non-blocking, buffered input stream when
   reading from the server?

   Default: true

   Instead of using slowQueryThreshold* to determine if a query is
   slow enough to be logged, maintain statistics that allow the
   driver to determine queries that are outside the 99th percentile?

   Default: true

   Since version: 5.1.4

   dumpQueriesOnException

   Should the driver dump the contents of the query sent to the
   server in the message for SQLExceptions?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.3

   enablePacketDebug

   When enabled, a ring-buffer of 'packetDebugBufferSize' packets

   Miscellaneous. 
   Properties and Descriptions

   useUnicode

   Should the driver use Unicode character encodings when handling
   strings? Should only be used when the driver can't determine the
   character set mapping, or you are trying to 'force' the driver to

   addition to standard MySQL-defined key:value pairs) to be passed
   to MySQL Server for display as connection attributes in the
   PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA.SESSION_CONNECT_ATTRS table. Example usage:
   connectionAttributes=key1:value1,key2:value2 This functionality is
   available for use with MySQL Server version 5.6 or later only.
   Earlier versions of MySQL Server do not support connection
   attributes, causing this configuration option will be ignored.
   Setting connectionAttributes=none will cause connection attribute
   processing to be bypassed, for situations where Connection
   creation/initialization speed is critical.

   Since version: 5.1.25

   connectionCollation

   If set, tells the server to use this collation via 'set
   collation_connection'

   Since version: 3.0.13

   useBlobToStoreUTF8OutsideBMP

   Tells the driver to treat [MEDIUM/LONG]BLOB columns as
   [LONG]VARCHAR columns holding text encoded in UTF-8 that has
   characters outside the BMP (4-byte encodings), which MySQL server
   can't handle natively.

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.1.3

   utf8OutsideBmpExcludedColumnNamePattern

   When "useBlobToStoreUTF8OutsideBMP" is set to "true", column names
   matching the given regex will still be treated as BLOBs unless
   they match the regex specified for
   "utf8OutsideBmpIncludedColumnNamePattern". The regex must follow
   the patterns used for the java.util.regex package.

   Since version: 5.1.3

   utf8OutsideBmpIncludedColumnNamePattern

   Used to specify exclusion rules to
   "utf8OutsideBmpExcludedColumnNamePattern". The regex must follow

   A comma-separated list of name/value pairs to be sent as SET
   SESSION ... to the server when the driver connects.

   Since version: 3.1.8

   useColumnNamesInFindColumn

   Prior to JDBC-4.0, the JDBC specification had a bug related to
   what could be given as a "column name" to ResultSet methods like
   findColumn(), or getters that took a String property. JDBC-4.0
   clarified "column name" to mean the label, as given in an "AS"
   clause and returned by ResultSetMetaData.getColumnLabel(), and if
   no AS clause, the column name. Setting this property to "true"
   will give behavior that is congruent to JDBC-3.0 and earlier
   versions of the JDBC specification, but which because of the
   specification bug could give unexpected results. This property is
   preferred over "useOldAliasMetadataBehavior" unless you need the
   specific behavior that it provides with respect to
   ResultSetMetadata.

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.1.7

   allowNanAndInf

   Should the driver allow NaN or +/- INF values in
   PreparedStatement.setDouble()?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.5

   autoClosePStmtStreams

   Should the driver automatically call .close() on streams/readers
   passed as arguments via set*() methods?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.12

   autoDeserialize

   Should the driver automatically detect and de-serialize objects
   stored in BLOB fields?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.5

   blobsAreStrings

   Should the driver always treat BLOBs as Strings - specifically to
   work around dubious metadata returned by the server for GROUP BY
   clauses?

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.0.8

   capitalizeTypeNames

   Capitalize type names in DatabaseMetaData? (usually only useful
   when using WebObjects, true/false, defaults to 'false')

   Default: true

   Since version: 2.0.7

   The character encoding to use for sending and retrieving TEXT,
   MEDIUMTEXT and LONGTEXT values instead of the configured
   connection characterEncoding

   Since version: 5.0.0

   clobberStreamingResults

   This will cause a 'streaming' ResultSet to be automatically
   closed, and any outstanding data still streaming from the server
   to be discarded if another query is executed before all the data
   has been read from the server.

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.0.9

   compensateOnDuplicateKeyUpdateCounts

   Should the driver compensate for the update counts of "ON
   DUPLICATE KEY" INSERT statements (2 = 1, 0 = 1) when using
   prepared statements?

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.1.7

   continueBatchOnError

   Should the driver continue processing batch commands if one
   statement fails. The JDBC spec allows either way (defaults to
   'true').

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.0.3

   createDatabaseIfNotExist

   Creates the database given in the URL if it doesn't yet exist.
   Assumes the configured user has permissions to create databases.

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.9

   detectCustomCollations

   Should the driver detect custom charsets/collations installed on
   server (true/false, defaults to 'false'). If this option set to
   'true' driver gets actual charsets/collations from server each
   time connection establishes. This could slow down connection
   initialization significantly.

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.1.29

   emptyStringsConvertToZero

   Should the driver allow conversions from empty string fields to
   numeric values of '0'?

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.1.8

   emulateLocators

   Should the driver emulate java.sql.Blobs with locators? With this
   feature enabled, the driver will delay loading the actual Blob
   data until the one of the retrieval methods (getInputStream(),
   getBytes(), and so forth) on the blob data stream has been
   accessed. For this to work, you must use a column alias with the
   value of the column to the actual name of the Blob. The feature
   also has the following restrictions: The SELECT that created the
   result set must reference only one table, the table must have a
   primary key; the SELECT must alias the original blob column name,
   specified as a string, to an alternate name; the SELECT must cover
   all columns that make up the primary key.

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.0

   emulateUnsupportedPstmts

   Should the driver detect prepared statements that are not
   supported by the server, and replace them with client-side
   emulated versions?

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.1.7

   exceptionInterceptors

   Comma-delimited list of classes that implement
   com.mysql.jdbc.ExceptionInterceptor. These classes will be
   instantiated one per Connection instance, and all SQLExceptions
   thrown by the driver will be allowed to be intercepted by these
   interceptors, in a chained fashion, with the first class listed as
   the head of the chain.

   Since version: 5.1.8

   functionsNeverReturnBlobs

   Should the driver always treat data from functions returning BLOBs
   as Strings - specifically to work around dubious metadata returned
   by the server for GROUP BY clauses?

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.0.8

   generateSimpleParameterMetadata

   Should the driver generate simplified parameter metadata for
   PreparedStatements when no metadata is available either because
   the server couldn't support preparing the statement, or
   server-side prepared statements are disabled?

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.0.5

   getProceduresReturnsFunctions

   Pre-JDBC4 DatabaseMetaData API has only the getProcedures() and
   getProcedureColumns() methods, so they return metadata info for
   both stored procedures and functions. JDBC4 was extended with the
   getFunctions() and getFunctionColumns() methods and the expected
   behaviours of previous methods are not well defined. For JDBC4 and
   higher, default 'true' value of the option means that calls of
   DatabaseMetaData.getProcedures() and
   DatabaseMetaData.getProcedureColumns() return metadata for both
   procedures and functions as before, keeping backward
   compatibility. Setting this property to 'false' decouples
   Connector/J from its pre-JDBC4 behaviours for
   DatabaseMetaData.getProcedures() and
   DatabaseMetaData.getProcedureColumns(), forcing them to return
   metadata for procedures only.

   Default: true

   Since version: 5.1.26

   ignoreNonTxTables

   Ignore non-transactional table warning for rollback? (defaults to
   'false').

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.0.9

   jdbcCompliantTruncation

   Should the driver throw java.sql.DataTruncation exceptions when
   data is truncated as is required by the JDBC specification when
   connected to a server that supports warnings (MySQL 4.1.0 and
   newer)? This property has no effect if the server sql-mode
   includes STRICT_TRANS_TABLES.

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.1.2

   loadBalanceAutoCommitStatementRegex

   When load-balancing is enabled for auto-commit statements (via
   loadBalanceAutoCommitStatementThreshold), the statement counter
   will only increment when the SQL matches the regular expression.
   By default, every statement issued matches.

   Since version: 5.1.15

   loadBalanceAutoCommitStatementThreshold

   When auto-commit is enabled, the number of statements which should
   be executed before triggering load-balancing to rebalance. Default
   value of 0 causes load-balanced connections to only rebalance when
   exceptions are encountered, or auto-commit is disabled and
   transactions are explicitly committed or rolled back.

   Default: 0

   Since version: 5.1.15

   loadBalanceBlacklistTimeout

   Time in milliseconds between checks of servers which are
   unavailable, by controlling how long a server lives in the global
   blacklist.

   Default: 0

   Since version: 5.1.0

   loadBalanceConnectionGroup

   Logical group of load-balanced connections within a classloader,
   used to manage different groups independently. If not specified,
   live management of load-balanced connections is disabled.

   Since version: 5.1.13

   loadBalanceExceptionChecker

   Fully-qualified class name of custom exception checker. The class
   must implement com.mysql.jdbc.LoadBalanceExceptionChecker
   interface, and is used to inspect SQLExceptions and determine
   whether they should trigger fail-over to another host in a
   load-balanced deployment.

   Default: com.mysql.jdbc.StandardLoadBalanceExceptionChecker

   Since version: 5.1.13

   loadBalancePingTimeout

   Time in milliseconds to wait for ping response from each of
   load-balanced physical connections when using load-balanced
   Connection.

   Default: 0

   Since version: 5.1.13

   loadBalanceSQLExceptionSubclassFailover

   Comma-delimited list of classes/interfaces used by default
   load-balanced exception checker to determine whether a given
   SQLException should trigger failover. The comparison is done using
   Class.isInstance(SQLException) using the thrown SQLException.

   Since version: 5.1.13

   loadBalanceSQLStateFailover

   Comma-delimited list of SQLState codes used by default
   load-balanced exception checker to determine whether a given
   SQLException should trigger failover. The SQLState of a given
   SQLException is evaluated to determine whether it begins with any
   value in the comma-delimited list.

   Since version: 5.1.13

   loadBalanceValidateConnectionOnSwapServer

   Should the load-balanced Connection explicitly check whether the
   connection is live when swapping to a new physical connection at
   commit/rollback?

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.1.13

   maxRows

   The maximum number of rows to return (0, the default means return
   all rows).

   Default: -1

   Since version: all versions

   netTimeoutForStreamingResults

   What value should the driver automatically set the server setting
   'net_write_timeout' to when the streaming result sets feature is
   in use? (value has unit of seconds, the value '0' means the driver
   will not try and adjust this value)

   Default: 600

   Since version: 5.1.0

   noAccessToProcedureBodies

   When determining procedure parameter types for CallableStatements,
   and the connected user can't access procedure bodies through "SHOW
   CREATE PROCEDURE" or select on mysql.proc should the driver
   instead create basic metadata (all parameters reported as IN
   VARCHARs, but allowing registerOutParameter() to be called on them
   anyway) instead of throwing an exception?

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.0.3

   noDatetimeStringSync

   Don't ensure that
   ResultSet.getDatetimeType().toString().equals(ResultSet.getString(
   ))

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.7

   noTimezoneConversionForTimeType

   Don't convert TIME values using the server timezone if
   'useTimezone'='true'

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.0.0

   nullCatalogMeansCurrent

   When DatabaseMetadataMethods ask for a 'catalog' parameter, does
   the value null mean use the current catalog? (this is not
   JDBC-compliant, but follows legacy behavior from earlier versions
   of the driver)

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.1.8

   nullNamePatternMatchesAll

   Should DatabaseMetaData methods that accept *pattern parameters
   treat null the same as '%' (this is not JDBC-compliant, however
   older versions of the driver accepted this departure from the
   specification)

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.1.8

   overrideSupportsIntegrityEnhancementFacility

   Should the driver return "true" for
   DatabaseMetaData.supportsIntegrityEnhancementFacility() even if
   the database doesn't support it to workaround applications that
   require this method to return "true" to signal support of foreign
   keys, even though the SQL specification states that this facility
   contains much more than just foreign key support (one such
   application being OpenOffice)?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.12

   padCharsWithSpace

   If a result set column has the CHAR type and the value does not
   fill the amount of characters specified in the DDL for the column,
   should the driver pad the remaining characters with space (for
   ANSI compliance)?

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.0.6

   pedantic

   Follow the JDBC spec to the letter.

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.0.0

   pinGlobalTxToPhysicalConnection

   When using XAConnections, should the driver ensure that operations
   on a given XID are always routed to the same physical connection?
   This allows the XAConnection to support "XA START ... JOIN" after
   "XA END" has been called

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.0.1

   populateInsertRowWithDefaultValues

   When using ResultSets that are CONCUR_UPDATABLE, should the driver
   pre-populate the "insert" row with default values from the DDL for
   the table used in the query so those values are immediately
   available for ResultSet accessors? This functionality requires a
   call to the database for metadata each time a result set of this
   type is created. If disabled (the default), the default values
   will be populated by the an internal call to refreshRow() which
   pulls back default values and/or values changed by triggers.

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.0.5

   processEscapeCodesForPrepStmts

   Should the driver process escape codes in queries that are
   prepared?

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.1.12

   queryTimeoutKillsConnection

   If the timeout given in Statement.setQueryTimeout() expires,
   should the driver forcibly abort the Connection instead of
   attempting to abort the query?

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.1.9

   relaxAutoCommit

   If the version of MySQL the driver connects to does not support
   transactions, still allow calls to commit(), rollback() and
   setAutoCommit() (true/false, defaults to 'false')?

   Default: false

   Since version: 2.0.13

   retainStatementAfterResultSetClose

   Should the driver retain the Statement reference in a ResultSet
   after ResultSet.close() has been called. This is not
   JDBC-compliant after JDBC-4.0.

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.11

   rollbackOnPooledClose

   Should the driver issue a rollback() when the logical connection
   in a pool is closed?

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.0.15

   Enables workarounds for bugs in Sun's JDBC compliance testsuite
   version 1.3

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.7

   serverTimezone

   Override detection/mapping of timezone. Used when timezone from
   server doesn't map to Java timezone

   Since version: 3.0.2

   statementInterceptors

   A comma-delimited list of classes that implement
   "com.mysql.jdbc.StatementInterceptor" that should be placed "in
   between" query execution to influence the results.
   StatementInterceptors are "chainable", the results returned by the
   "current" interceptor will be passed on to the next in in the
   chain, from left-to-right order, as specified in this property.

   Since version: 5.1.1

   strictFloatingPoint

   Used only in older versions of compliance test

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.0.0

   strictUpdates

   Should the driver do strict checking (all primary keys selected)
   of updatable result sets (true, false, defaults to 'true')?

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.0.4

   tinyInt1isBit

   Should the driver treat the datatype TINYINT(1) as the BIT type
   (because the server silently converts BIT -> TINYINT(1) when
   creating tables)?

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.0.16

   transformedBitIsBoolean

   If the driver converts TINYINT(1) to a different type, should it
   use BOOLEAN instead of BIT for future compatibility with
   MySQL-5.0, as MySQL-5.0 has a BIT type?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.9

   treatUtilDateAsTimestamp

   Should the driver treat java.util.Date as a TIMESTAMP for the
   purposes of PreparedStatement.setObject()?

   Default: true

   Since version: 5.0.5

   ultraDevHack

   Create PreparedStatements for prepareCall() when required, because
   UltraDev is broken and issues a prepareCall() for _all_
   statements? (true/false, defaults to 'false')

   Default: false

   Since version: 2.0.3

   useAffectedRows

   Don't set the CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS flag when connecting to the server
   (not JDBC-compliant, will break most applications that rely on
   "found" rows vs. "affected rows" for DML statements), but does
   cause "correct" update counts from "INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY
   UPDATE" statements to be returned by the server.

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.1.7

   useGmtMillisForDatetimes

   Convert between session timezone and GMT before creating Date and
   Timestamp instances (value of "false" is legacy behavior, "true"
   leads to more JDBC-compliant behavior.

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.12

   useHostsInPrivileges

   Add '@hostname' to users in
   DatabaseMetaData.getColumn/TablePrivileges() (true/false),
   defaults to 'true'.

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.0.2

   useInformationSchema

   When connected to MySQL-5.0.7 or newer, should the driver use the
   INFORMATION_SCHEMA to derive information used by DatabaseMetaData?

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.0.0

   useJDBCCompliantTimezoneShift

   Should the driver use JDBC-compliant rules when converting
   TIME/TIMESTAMP/DATETIME values' timezone information for those
   JDBC arguments which take a java.util.Calendar argument? (Notice
   that this option is exclusive of the "useTimezone=true"
   configuration option.)

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.0.0

   useLegacyDatetimeCode

   Use code for DATE/TIME/DATETIME/TIMESTAMP handling in result sets
   and statements that consistently handles timezone conversions from
   client to server and back again, or use the legacy code for these
   datatypes that has been in the driver for backwards-compatibility?

   Default: true

   Since version: 5.1.6

   useOldAliasMetadataBehavior

   Should the driver use the legacy behavior for "AS" clauses on
   columns and tables, and only return aliases (if any) for
   ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName() or
   ResultSetMetaData.getTableName() rather than the original
   column/table name? In 5.0.x, the default value was true.

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.0.4

   useOldUTF8Behavior

   Use the UTF-8 behavior the driver did when communicating with 4.0
   and older servers

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.6

   useOnlyServerErrorMessages

   Don't prepend 'standard' SQLState error messages to error messages
   returned by the server.

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.0.15

   useSSPSCompatibleTimezoneShift

   If migrating from an environment that was using server-side
   prepared statements, and the configuration property
   "useJDBCCompliantTimeZoneShift" set to "true", use compatible
   behavior when not using server-side prepared statements when
   sending TIMESTAMP values to the MySQL server.

   Default: false

   Since version: 5.0.5

   useServerPrepStmts

   Use server-side prepared statements if the server supports them?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.1.0

   useSqlStateCodes

   Use SQL Standard state codes instead of 'legacy' X/Open/SQL state
   codes (true/false), default is 'true'

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.1.3

   useStreamLengthsInPrepStmts

   Honor stream length parameter in
   PreparedStatement/ResultSet.setXXXStream() method calls
   (true/false, defaults to 'true')?

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.0.2

   useTimezone

   Convert time/date types between client and server timezones
   (true/false, defaults to 'false')?

   Default: false

   Since version: 3.0.2

   useUnbufferedInput

   Don't use BufferedInputStream for reading data from the server

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.0.11

   yearIsDateType

   Should the JDBC driver treat the MySQL type "YEAR" as a
   java.sql.Date, or as a SHORT?

   Default: true

   Since version: 3.1.9

   zeroDateTimeBehavior

   What should happen when the driver encounters DATETIME values that
   are composed entirely of zeros (used by MySQL to represent invalid
   dates)? Valid values are "exception", "round" and "convertToNull".

   Default: exception

   Since version: 3.1.4

   Connector/J also supports access to MySQL using named pipes on
   Windows NT, Windows 2000, or Windows XP using the
   NamedPipeSocketFactory as a plugin-socket factory using the
   socketFactory property. If you do not use a namedPipePath
   property, the default of '\\.\pipe\MySQL' is used. If you use the
   NamedPipeSocketFactory, the host name and port number values in
   the JDBC url are ignored. To enable this feature, use:
socketFactory=com.mysql.jdbc.NamedPipeSocketFactory

   Named pipes only work when connecting to a MySQL server on the
   same physical machine where the JDBC driver is running. In simple
   performance tests, named pipe access is between 30%-50% faster
   than the standard TCP/IP access. However, this varies per system,
   and named pipes are slower than TCP/IP in many Windows
   configurations.

   To create your own socket factories, follow the example code in
   com.mysql.jdbc.NamedPipeSocketFactory, or
   com.mysql.jdbc.StandardSocketFactory.

5.1.1 Properties Files for the useConfigs Option

   The useConfigs connection option is convenient shorthand for
   specifying combinations of options for particular scenarios. The
   argument values you can use with this option correspond to the
   names of .properties files within the Connector/J
   mysql-connector-java-version-bin.jar JAR file. For example, the
   Connector/J 5.1.9 driver includes the following configuration
   properties files:
$ unzip mysql-connector-java-5.1.19-bin.jar '*/configs/*'
Archive:  mysql-connector-java-5.1.19-bin.jar
   creating: com/mysql/jdbc/configs/

  inflating: com/mysql/jdbc/configs/fullDebug.properties
  inflating: com/mysql/jdbc/configs/maxPerformance.properties
  inflating: com/mysql/jdbc/configs/solarisMaxPerformance.properties

   To specify one of these combinations of options, specify
   useConfigs=3-0-Compat, useConfigs=maxPerformance, and so on. The
   following sections show the options that are part of each
   useConfigs setting. For the details of why each one is included,

5.2 JDBC API Implementation Notes

   MySQL Connector/J, as a rigorous implementation of the JDBC API
   (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/jdbc/index.html),
   passes all of the tests in the publicly available version of
   Oracle's JDBC compliance test suite. The JDBC specification is
   flexible on how certain functionality should be implemented. This
   section gives details on an interface-by-interface level about
   implementation decisions that might affect how you code
   applications with MySQL Connector/J.

     * BLOB
       Starting with Connector/J version 3.1.0, you can emulate BLOBs
       with locators by adding the property emulateLocators=true to
       your JDBC URL. Using this method, the driver will delay
       loading the actual BLOB data until you retrieve the other data
       and then use retrieval methods (getInputStream(), getBytes(),
       and so forth) on the BLOB data stream.
       You must use a column alias with the value of the column to
       the actual name of the BLOB, for example:
SELECT id, 'data' as blob_data from blobtable
       You must also follow these rules:

          + The SELECT
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/select.html) must
            reference only one table. The table must have a primary
            key
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/glossary.html#glo
            s_primary_key).

          + The SELECT
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/select.html) must
            alias the original BLOB column name, specified as a
            string, to an alternate name.

          + The SELECT
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/select.html) must
            cover all columns that make up the primary key.
       The BLOB implementation does not allow in-place modification
       (they are copies, as reported by the
       DatabaseMetaData.locatorsUpdateCopies() method). Because of
       this, use the corresponding PreparedStatement.setBlob() or
       ResultSet.updateBlob() (in the case of updatable result sets)
       methods to save changes back to the database.

     * CallableStatement
       Starting with Connector/J 3.1.1, stored procedures are
       supported when connecting to MySQL version 5.0 or newer using
       the CallableStatement interface. Currently, the
       getParameterMetaData() method of CallableStatement is not
       supported.

     * CLOB
       The CLOB implementation does not allow in-place modification
       (they are copies, as reported by the
       DatabaseMetaData.locatorsUpdateCopies() method). Because of
       this, use the PreparedStatement.setClob() method to save
       changes back to the database. The JDBC API does not have a
       ResultSet.updateClob() method.

     * Connection
       Unlike the pre-Connector/J JDBC driver (MM.MySQL), the
       isClosed() method does not ping the server to determine if it
       is available. In accordance with the JDBC specification, it
       only returns true if closed() has been called on the
       connection. If you need to determine if the connection is
       still valid, issue a simple query, such as SELECT 1. The
       driver will throw an exception if the connection is no longer
       valid.

     * DatabaseMetaData
       Foreign key
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/glossary.html#glos_for
       eign_key) information (getImportedKeys()/getExportedKeys() and
       getCrossReference()) is only available from InnoDB
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/innodb-storage-engine.
       html) tables. The driver uses SHOW CREATE TABLE
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/show-create-table.html
       ) to retrieve this information, so if any other storage
       engines add support for foreign keys, the driver would
       transparently support them as well.

     * PreparedStatement
       PreparedStatements are implemented by the driver, as MySQL
       does not have a prepared statement feature. Because of this,
       the driver does not implement getParameterMetaData() or
       getMetaData() as it would require the driver to have a
       complete SQL parser in the client.
       Starting with version 3.1.0 MySQL Connector/J, server-side
       prepared statements and binary-encoded result sets are used
       when the server supports them.
       Take care when using a server-side prepared statement with
       large parameters that are set using setBinaryStream(),
       setAsciiStream(), setUnicodeStream(), setBlob(), or setClob().
       To re-execute the statement with any large parameter changed
       to a nonlarge parameter, call clearParameters() and set all
       parameters again. The reason for this is as follows:

          + During both server-side prepared statements and
            client-side emulation, large data is exchanged only when
            PreparedStatement.execute() is called.

          + Once that has been done, the stream used to read the data
            on the client side is closed (as per the JDBC spec), and
            cannot be read from again.

          + If a parameter changes from large to nonlarge, the driver
            must reset the server-side state of the prepared
            statement to allow the parameter that is being changed to
            take the place of the prior large value. This removes all
            of the large data that has already been sent to the
            server, thus requiring the data to be re-sent, using the
            setBinaryStream(), setAsciiStream(), setUnicodeStream(),
            setBlob() or setClob() method.
       Consequently, to change the type of a parameter to a nonlarge
       one, you must call clearParameters() and set all parameters of
       the prepared statement again before it can be re-executed.

     * ResultSet
       By default, ResultSets are completely retrieved and stored in
       memory. In most cases this is the most efficient way to
       operate, and due to the design of the MySQL network protocol
       is easier to implement. If you are working with ResultSets
       that have a large number of rows or large values, and cannot
       allocate heap space in your JVM for the memory required, you
       can tell the driver to stream the results back one row at a
       time.
       To enable this functionality, create a Statement instance in
       the following manner:
stmt = conn.createStatement(java.sql.ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY,
              java.sql.ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY);
stmt.setFetchSize(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
       The combination of a forward-only, read-only result set, with
       a fetch size of Integer.MIN_VALUE serves as a signal to the
       driver to stream result sets row-by-row. After this, any
       result sets created with the statement will be retrieved
       row-by-row.
       There are some caveats with this approach. You must read all
       of the rows in the result set (or close it) before you can
       issue any other queries on the connection, or an exception
       will be thrown.
       The earliest the locks these statements hold can be released
       (whether they be MyISAM table-level locks or row-level locks
       in some other storage engine such as InnoDB) is when the
       statement completes.
       If the statement is within scope of a transaction, then locks
       are released when the transaction completes (which implies
       that the statement needs to complete first). As with most
       other databases, statements are not complete until all the
       results pending on the statement are read or the active result
       set for the statement is closed.
       Therefore, if using streaming results, process them as quickly
       as possible if you want to maintain concurrent access to the
       tables referenced by the statement producing the result set.

     * ResultSetMetaData
       The isAutoIncrement() method only works when using MySQL
       servers 4.0 and newer.

     * Statement
       When using versions of the JDBC driver earlier than 3.2.1, and
       connected to server versions earlier than 5.0.3, the
       setFetchSize() method has no effect, other than to toggle
       result set streaming as described above.
       Connector/J 5.0.0 and later include support for both
       Statement.cancel() and Statement.setQueryTimeout(). Both
       require MySQL 5.0.0 or newer server, and require a separate
       connection to issue the KILL QUERY
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/kill.html) statement.
       In the case of setQueryTimeout(), the implementation creates
       an additional thread to handle the timeout functionality.
       Note
       Failures to cancel the statement for setQueryTimeout() may
       manifest themselves as RuntimeException rather than failing
       silently, as there is currently no way to unblock the thread
       that is executing the query being cancelled due to timeout
       expiration and have it throw the exception instead.
       Note
       The MySQL statement KILL QUERY
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/kill.html) (which is
       what the driver uses to implement Statement.cancel()) is
       non-deterministic; thus, avoid the use of Statement.cancel()
       if possible. If no query is in process, the next query issued
       will be killed by the server. This race condition is guarded
       against as of Connector/J 5.1.18.
       MySQL does not support SQL cursors, and the JDBC driver
       doesn't emulate them, so setCursorName() has no effect.
       Connector/J 5.1.3 and later include two additional methods:

          + setLocalInfileInputStream() sets an InputStream instance
            that will be used to send data to the MySQL server for a
            LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/load-data.html)
            statement rather than a FileInputStream or URLInputStream
            that represents the path given as an argument to the
            statement.
            This stream will be read to completion upon execution of
            a LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/load-data.html)
            statement, and will automatically be closed by the
            driver, so it needs to be reset before each call to
            execute*() that would cause the MySQL server to request
            data to fulfill the request for LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/load-data.html).
            If this value is set to NULL, the driver will revert to
            using a FileInputStream or URLInputStream as required.

          + getLocalInfileInputStream() returns the InputStream
            instance that will be used to send data in response to a
            LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/load-data.html)
            statement.
            This method returns NULL if no such stream has been set
            using setLocalInfileInputStream().

5.3 Java, JDBC and MySQL Types

   MySQL Connector/J is flexible in the way it handles conversions
   between MySQL data types and Java data types.

   In general, any MySQL data type can be converted to a
   java.lang.String, and any numeric type can be converted to any of
   the Java numeric types, although round-off, overflow, or loss of
   precision may occur.
   Note

   All TEXT types return Types.LONGVARCHAR with different
   getPrecision() values (65535, 255, 16777215, and 2147483647
   respectively) with getColumnType() returning -1. This behavior is
   intentional even though TINYTEXT does not fall, regarding to its
   size, within the LONGVARCHAR category. This is to avoid different
   handling inside the same base type. And getColumnType() returns -1
   because the internal server handling is of type TEXT, which is
   similar to BLOB.

   Also note that getColumnTypeName() will return VARCHAR even though
   getColumnType() returns Types.LONGVARCHAR, because VARCHAR is the
   designated column database-specific name for this type.

   Starting with Connector/J 3.1.0, the JDBC driver issues warnings
   or throws DataTruncation exceptions as is required by the JDBC
   specification unless the connection was configured not to do so by
   using the property jdbcCompliantTruncation and setting it to
   false.

   The conversions that are always guaranteed to work are listed in
   the following table. The first column lists one or more MySQL data
   types, and the second column lists one or more Java types to which
   the MySQL types can be converted.

   Table 5.1 Connection Properties - Miscellaneous
   These MySQL Data Types Can always be converted to these Java types
   CHAR, VARCHAR, BLOB, TEXT, ENUM, and SET java.lang.String,
   java.io.InputStream, java.io.Reader, java.sql.Blob, java.sql.Clob
   FLOAT, REAL, DOUBLE PRECISION, NUMERIC, DECIMAL, TINYINT,
   SMALLINT, MEDIUMINT, INTEGER, BIGINT java.lang.String,
   java.lang.Short, java.lang.Integer, java.lang.Long,
   java.lang.Double, java.math.BigDecimal
   DATE, TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP java.lang.String, java.sql.Date,
   java.sql.Timestamp
   Note

   Round-off, overflow or loss of precision may occur if you choose a
   Java numeric data type that has less precision or capacity than
   the MySQL data type you are converting to/from.

   The ResultSet.getObject() method uses the type conversions between
   MySQL and Java types, following the JDBC specification where
   appropriate. The value returned by
   ResultSetMetaData.GetColumnClassName() is also shown below. For
   more information on the java.sql.Types classes see Java 2 Platform
   Types
   (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/sql/Types.html).

   ENUM('value1','value2',...) CHAR java.lang.String
   SET('value1','value2',...) CHAR java.lang.String

5.4 Using Character Sets and Unicode

   All strings sent from the JDBC driver to the server are converted
   automatically from native Java Unicode form to the client
   character encoding, including all queries sent using
   Statement.execute(), Statement.executeUpdate(),
   Statement.executeQuery() as well as all PreparedStatement and
   CallableStatement parameters with the exclusion of parameters set
   using setBytes(), setBinaryStream(), setAsciiStream(),
   setUnicodeStream() and setBlob().

Number of Encodings Per Connection

   In MySQL Server 4.1 and higher, Connector/J supports a single
   character encoding between client and server, and any number of
   character encodings for data returned by the server to the client
   in ResultSets.

   Prior to MySQL Server 4.1, Connector/J supported a single
   character encoding per connection, which could either be
   automatically detected from the server configuration, or could be
   configured by the user through the useUnicode and
   characterEncoding properties.

Setting the Character Encoding

   The character encoding between client and server is automatically
   detected upon connection. You specify the encoding on the server
   using the character_set_server
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/server-system-variables.ht
   ml#sysvar_character_set_server) for server versions 4.1.0 and
   newer, and character_set system variable for server versions older
   than 4.1.0. The driver automatically uses the encoding specified
   by the server. For more information, see Server Character Set and
   Collation
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/charset-server.html).

   For example, to use 4-byte UTF-8 character sets with Connector/J,
   configure the MySQL server with character_set_server=utf8mb4
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/server-system-variables.ht
   ml#sysvar_character_set_server), and leave characterEncoding out
   of the Connector/J connection string. Connector/J will then
   autodetect the UTF-8 setting.

   To override the automatically detected encoding on the client
   side, use the characterEncoding property in the URL used to
   connect to the server.

   To allow multiple character sets to be sent from the client, use
   the UTF-8 encoding, either by configuring utf8 as the default
   server character set, or by configuring the JDBC driver to use
   UTF-8 through the characterEncoding property.

   When specifying character encodings on the client side, use
   Java-style names. The following table lists MySQL character set
   names and the corresponding Java-style names:

   Table 5.3 MySQL to Java Encoding Name Translations
   MySQL Character Set Name Java-Style Character Encoding Name
   ascii US-ASCII
   big5 Big5
   gbk GBK
   sjis SJIS (or Cp932 or MS932 for MySQL Server < 4.1.11)
   cp932 Cp932 or MS932 (MySQL Server > 4.1.11)
   gb2312 EUC_CN
   ujis EUC_JP
   euckr EUC_KR
   latin1 Cp1252
   latin2 ISO8859_2

   cp1251 Cp1251
   cp1257 Cp1257
   macroman MacRoman
   macce MacCentralEurope
   utf8 UTF-8
   ucs2 UnicodeBig
   Warning

   Do not issue the query set names with Connector/J, as the driver
   will not detect that the character set has changed, and will
   continue to use the character set detected during the initial
   connection setup.

5.5 Connecting Securely Using SSL

   SSL in MySQL Connector/J encrypts all data (other than the initial
   handshake) between the JDBC driver and the server. There is a
   performance penalty for enabling SSL, the severity of which
   depends on multiple factors including (but not limited to) the
   size of the query, the amount of data returned, the server
   hardware, the SSL library used, the network bandwidth, and so on.

   For SSL support to work, you must have the following:

     * A JDK that includes JSSE (Java Secure Sockets Extension), like
       JDK-1.4.1 or newer. SSL does not currently work with a JDK
       that you can add JSSE to, like JDK-1.2.x or JDK-1.3.x due to
       the following JSSE bug:
       http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4273544
       .html

     * A MySQL server that supports SSL and has been compiled and
       configured to do so, which is MySQL 4.0.4 or later. For more
       information, see Configuring MySQL for SSL
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/configuring-for-ssl.ht
       ml).

     * A client certificate (covered later in this section)

   The system works through two Java truststore files, one file
   contains the certificate information for the server (truststore in
   the examples below). The other file contains the certificate for
   the client (keystore in the examples below). All Java truststore
   files are password protected by supplying a suitable password to
   the keytool when you create the files. You need the file names and
   associated passwords to create an SSL connection.

   You will first need to import the MySQL server CA Certificate into
   a Java truststore. A sample MySQL server CA Certificate is located
   in the SSL subdirectory of the MySQL source distribution. This is
   what SSL will use to determine if you are communicating with a
   secure MySQL server. Alternatively, use the CA Certificate that
   you have generated or been provided with by your SSL provider.

   To use Java's keytool to create a truststore in the current
   directory , and import the server's CA certificate (cacert.pem),
   you can do the following (assuming that keytool is in your path.
   The keytool is typically located in the bin subdirectory of your
   JDK or JRE):
shell> keytool -import -alias mysqlServerCACert \
         -file cacert.pem -keystore truststore

   Enter the password when prompted for the keystore file.
   Interaction with keytool looks like this:
Enter keystore password:  *********
Owner: EMAILADDRESS=walrus@example.com, CN=Walrus,
       O=MySQL AB, L=Orenburg, ST=Some-State, C=RU
Issuer: EMAILADDRESS=walrus@example.com, CN=Walrus,
       O=MySQL AB, L=Orenburg, ST=Some-State, C=RU
Serial number: 0
Valid from:
   Fri Aug 02 16:55:53 CDT 2002 until: Sat Aug 02 16:55:53 CDT 2003
Certificate fingerprints:
    MD5:  61:91:A0:F2:03:07:61:7A:81:38:66:DA:19:C4:8D:AB
    SHA1: 25:77:41:05:D5:AD:99:8C:14:8C:CA:68:9C:2F:B8:89:C3:34:4D:6C
Trust this certificate? [no]:  yes
Certificate was added to keystore

   You then have two options: either import the client certificate
   that matches the CA certificate you just imported, or create a new
   client certificate.

   Importing an existing certificate requires the certificate to be
   in DER format. You can use openssl to convert an existing
   certificate into the new format. For example:
shell> openssl x509 -outform DER -in client-cert.pem -out client.cert

   Now import the converted certificate into your keystore using
   keytool:
shell> keytool -import -file client.cert -keystore keystore -alias my
sqlClientCertificate

   To generate your own client certificate, use keytool to create a
   suitable certificate and add it to the keystore file:
shell> keytool -genkey -keyalg rsa \
     -alias mysqlClientCertificate -keystore keystore

   Keytool will prompt you for the following information, and create
   a keystore named keystore in the current directory.

   Respond with information that is appropriate for your situation:
Enter keystore password:  *********
What is your first and last name?
  [Unknown]:  Matthews
What is the name of your organizational unit?
  [Unknown]:  Software Development
What is the name of your organization?
  [Unknown]:  MySQL AB
What is the name of your City or Locality?
  [Unknown]:  Flossmoor
What is the name of your State or Province?
  [Unknown]:  IL
What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
  [Unknown]:  US
Is <CN=Matthews, OU=Software Development, O=MySQL AB,
 L=Flossmoor, ST=IL, C=US> correct?
  [no]:  y

Enter key password for <mysqlClientCertificate>
        (RETURN if same as keystore password):

   Finally, to get JSSE to use the keystore and truststore that you
   have generated, you need to set the following system properties
   when you start your JVM, replacing path_to_keystore_file with the
   full path to the keystore file you created,
   path_to_truststore_file with the path to the truststore file you
   created, and using the appropriate password values for each
   property. You can do this either on the command line:
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=path_to_keystore_file
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=password
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=path_to_truststore_file
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=password

   Or you can set the values directly within the application:
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStore","path_to_keystore_file");
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword","password");
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStore","path_to_truststore_fil
e");
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword","password");

   You will also need to set useSSL to true in your connection
   parameters for MySQL Connector/J, either by adding useSSL=true to
   your URL, or by setting the property useSSL to true in the
   java.util.Properties instance you pass to
   DriverManager.getConnection().

   You can test that SSL is working by turning on JSSE debugging (as
   detailed below), and look for the following key events:

   JSSE provides debugging (to stdout) when you set the following
   system property: -Djavax.net.debug=all This will tell you what
   keystores and truststores are being used, as well as what is going
   on during the SSL handshake and certificate exchange. It will be
   helpful when trying to determine what is not working when trying
   to get an SSL connection to happen.

5.6 Connecting Using PAM Authentication

   Java applications using Connector/J 5.1.21 and higher can connect
   to MySQL servers that use the pluggable authentication module
   (PAM) authentication scheme.

   For PAM authentication to work, you must have the following:

     * A MySQL server that supports PAM authentication: a commercial
       distribution of MySQL 5.5.16 or higher. See The PAM
       Authentication Plugin
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/pam-authentication-plu
       gin.html) for more information. Connector/J implements the
       same cleartext authentication method as in The Cleartext
       Client-Side Authentication Plugin
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/cleartext-authenticati
       on-plugin.html).

     * SSL capability, as explained in Section 5.5, "Connecting
       Securely Using SSL." Because the PAM authentication scheme
       sends the original password to the server, the connection to
       the server must be encrypted.

   PAM authentication support is enabled by default in Connector/J
   5.1.21 and up, so no extra configuration is needed.

   To disable the PAM authentication feature, specify
   mysql_clear_password (the method) or
   com.mysql.jdbc.authentication.MysqlClearPasswordPlugin (the class
   name) in the comma-separated list of arguments for the
   disabledAuthenticationPlugins connection option. See Section 5.1,
   "Driver/Datasource Class Names, URL Syntax and Configuration
   Properties for Connector/J" for details about that connection
   option.

5.7 Using Master/Slave Replication with ReplicationConnection

   See Section 8.3, "Master/Slave Replication with
   ReplicationConnection" for details on the topic.

5.8 Mapping MySQL Error Numbers to JDBC SQLState Codes

   The table below provides a mapping of the MySQL error numbers to
   JDBC SQLState values.

Chapter 6 JDBC Concepts

   This section provides some general JDBC background.

6.1 Connecting to MySQL Using the JDBC DriverManager Interface

   When you are using JDBC outside of an application server, the
   DriverManager class manages the establishment of connections.

   Specify to the DriverManager which JDBC drivers to try to make
   Connections with. The easiest way to do this is to use
   Class.forName() on the class that implements the java.sql.Driver
   interface. With MySQL Connector/J, the name of this class is
   com.mysql.jdbc.Driver. With this method, you could use an external
   configuration file to supply the driver class name and driver
   parameters to use when connecting to a database.

   The following section of Java code shows how you might register
   MySQL Connector/J from the main() method of your application. If
   testing this code, first read the installation section at Chapter
   3, "Connector/J Installation," to make sure you have connector
   installed correctly and the CLASSPATH set up. Also, ensure that
   MySQL is configured to accept external TCP/IP connections.
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

// Notice, do not import com.mysql.jdbc.*
// or you will have problems!

public class LoadDriver {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // The newInstance() call is a work around for some
            // broken Java implementations

            Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver").newInstance();
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            // handle the error
        }
    }
}

   After the driver has been registered with the DriverManager, you
   can obtain a Connection instance that is connected to a particular
   database by calling DriverManager.getConnection():

   Example 6.1 Connector/J: Obtaining a connection from the
   DriverManager

   If you have not already done so, please review the section Section
   6.1, "Connecting to MySQL Using the JDBC DriverManager Interface"
   before working with these examples.

   This example shows how you can obtain a Connection instance from
   the DriverManager. There are a few different signatures for the
   getConnection() method. Consult the API documentation that comes
   with your JDK for more specific information on how to use them.
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

Connection conn = null;
...
try {
    conn =
       DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/test?" +
                                   "user=monty&password=greatsqldb");

    // Do something with the Connection

   ...
} catch (SQLException ex) {
    // handle any errors
    System.out.println("SQLException: " + ex.getMessage());
    System.out.println("SQLState: " + ex.getSQLState());
    System.out.println("VendorError: " + ex.getErrorCode());
}

   Once a Connection is established, it can be used to create
   Statement and PreparedStatement objects, as well as retrieve
   metadata about the database. This is explained in the following
   sections.

6.2 Using JDBC Statement Objects to Execute SQL

   Statement objects allow you to execute basic SQL queries and
   retrieve the results through the ResultSet class, which is
   described later.

   To create a Statement instance, you call the createStatement()
   method on the Connection object you have retrieved using one of
   the DriverManager.getConnection() or DataSource.getConnection()
   methods described earlier.

   Once you have a Statement instance, you can execute a SELECT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/select.html) query by
   calling the executeQuery(String) method with the SQL you want to
   use.

   To update data in the database, use the executeUpdate(String SQL)
   method. This method returns the number of rows matched by the
   update statement, not the number of rows that were modified.

   If you do not know ahead of time whether the SQL statement will be
   a SELECT (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/select.html) or
   an UPDATE
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/update.html)/INSERT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/insert.html), then you can
   use the execute(String SQL) method. This method will return true
   if the SQL query was a SELECT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/select.html), or false if
   it was an UPDATE
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/update.html), INSERT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/insert.html), or DELETE
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/delete.html) statement. If
   the statement was a SELECT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/select.html) query, you
   can retrieve the results by calling the getResultSet() method. If
   the statement was an UPDATE
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/update.html), INSERT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/insert.html), or DELETE
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/delete.html) statement,
   you can retrieve the affected rows count by calling
   getUpdateCount() on the Statement instance.

   Example 6.2 Connector/J: Using java.sql.Statement to execute a
   SELECT query
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Statement;
import java.sql.ResultSet;

// assume that conn is an already created JDBC connection (see previo
us examples)

Statement stmt = null;
ResultSet rs = null;

try {
    stmt = conn.createStatement();
    rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT foo FROM bar");

    // or alternatively, if you don't know ahead of time that
    // the query will be a SELECT...

    if (stmt.execute("SELECT foo FROM bar")) {
        rs = stmt.getResultSet();
    }

    // Now do something with the ResultSet ....
}
catch (SQLException ex){
    // handle any errors
    System.out.println("SQLException: " + ex.getMessage());
    System.out.println("SQLState: " + ex.getSQLState());
    System.out.println("VendorError: " + ex.getErrorCode());
}
finally {
    // it is a good idea to release
    // resources in a finally{} block
    // in reverse-order of their creation
    // if they are no-longer needed

    if (rs != null) {
        try {
            rs.close();
        } catch (SQLException sqlEx) { } // ignore

        rs = null;
    }

    if (stmt != null) {
        try {
            stmt.close();
        } catch (SQLException sqlEx) { } // ignore

        stmt = null;
    }
}

6.3 Using JDBC CallableStatements to Execute Stored Procedures

   Starting with MySQL server version 5.0 when used with Connector/J
   3.1.1 or newer, the java.sql.CallableStatement interface is fully
   implemented with the exception of the getParameterMetaData()
   method.

   For more information on MySQL stored procedures, please refer to
   http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/stored-routines.html.

   Connector/J exposes stored procedure functionality through JDBC's
   CallableStatement interface.
   Note

   Current versions of MySQL server do not return enough information
   for the JDBC driver to provide result set metadata for callable
   statements. This means that when using CallableStatement,
   ResultSetMetaData may return NULL.

   The following example shows a stored procedure that returns the
   value of inOutParam incremented by 1, and the string passed in
   using inputParam as a ResultSet:

   Example 6.3 Connector/J: Calling Stored Procedures
CREATE PROCEDURE demoSp(IN inputParam VARCHAR(255), \
                        INOUT inOutParam INT)
BEGIN
    DECLARE z INT;
    SET z = inOutParam + 1;
    SET inOutParam = z;

    SELECT inputParam;

    SELECT CONCAT('zyxw', inputParam);
END

   To use the demoSp procedure with Connector/J, follow these steps:

    1. Prepare the callable statement by using
       Connection.prepareCall().
       Notice that you have to use JDBC escape syntax, and that the
       parentheses surrounding the parameter placeholders are not
       optional:
       Example 6.4 Connector/J: Using Connection.prepareCall()
import java.sql.CallableStatement;

...

    //
    // Prepare a call to the stored procedure 'demoSp'
    // with two parameters
    //
    // Notice the use of JDBC-escape syntax ({call ...})
    //

    CallableStatement cStmt = conn.prepareCall("{call demoSp(?, ?)}")
;



    cStmt.setString(1, "abcdefg");
       Note
       Connection.prepareCall() is an expensive method, due to the
       metadata retrieval that the driver performs to support output
       parameters. For performance reasons, minimize unnecessary
       calls to Connection.prepareCall() by reusing CallableStatement
       instances in your code.

    2. Register the output parameters (if any exist)
       To retrieve the values of output parameters (parameters
       specified as OUT or INOUT when you created the stored
       procedure), JDBC requires that they be specified before
       statement execution using the various
       registerOutputParameter() methods in the CallableStatement
       interface:
       Example 6.5 Connector/J: Registering output parameters
import java.sql.Types;
...
//
// Connector/J supports both named and indexed
// output parameters. You can register output
// parameters using either method, as well
// as retrieve output parameters using either
// method, regardless of what method was
// used to register them.
//
// The following examples show how to use
// the various methods of registering
// output parameters (you should of course
// use only one registration per parameter).
//

//
// Registers the second parameter as output, and
// uses the type 'INTEGER' for values returned from
// getObject()
//

cStmt.registerOutParameter(2, Types.INTEGER);

//
// Registers the named parameter 'inOutParam', and
// uses the type 'INTEGER' for values returned from
// getObject()
//

cStmt.registerOutParameter("inOutParam", Types.INTEGER);
...

    3. Set the input parameters (if any exist)
       Input and in/out parameters are set as for PreparedStatement
       objects. However, CallableStatement also supports setting
       parameters by name:
       Example 6.6 Connector/J: Setting CallableStatement input
       parameters
...

    //
    // Set a parameter by index
    //

    cStmt.setString(1, "abcdefg");

    //
    // Alternatively, set a parameter using
    // the parameter name
    //

    cStmt.setString("inputParameter", "abcdefg");

    //
    // Set the 'in/out' parameter using an index
    //

    cStmt.setInt(2, 1);

    //
    // Alternatively, set the 'in/out' parameter
    // by name
    //

    cStmt.setInt("inOutParam", 1);

...

    4. Execute the CallableStatement, and retrieve any result sets or
       output parameters.
       Although CallableStatement supports calling any of the
       Statement execute methods (executeUpdate(), executeQuery() or
       execute()), the most flexible method to call is execute(), as
       you do not need to know ahead of time if the stored procedure
       returns result sets:
       Example 6.7 Connector/J: Retrieving results and output
       parameter values
...

    boolean hadResults = cStmt.execute();

    //
    // Process all returned result sets
    //

    while (hadResults) {
        ResultSet rs = cStmt.getResultSet();

        // process result set
        ...

        hadResults = cStmt.getMoreResults();
    }

    //
    // Retrieve output parameters
    //
    // Connector/J supports both index-based and
    // name-based retrieval
    //

    int outputValue = cStmt.getInt(2); // index-based

    outputValue = cStmt.getInt("inOutParam"); // name-based

...

6.4 Retrieving AUTO_INCREMENT Column Values through JDBC

   Before version 3.0 of the JDBC API, there was no standard way of
   retrieving key values from databases that supported auto increment
   or identity columns. With older JDBC drivers for MySQL, you could
   always use a MySQL-specific method on the Statement interface, or
   issue the query SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID() after issuing an INSERT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/insert.html) to a table
   that had an AUTO_INCREMENT key. Using the MySQL-specific method
   call isn't portable, and issuing a SELECT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/select.html) to get the
   AUTO_INCREMENT key's value requires another round-trip to the
   database, which isn't as efficient as possible. The following code
   snippets demonstrate the three different ways to retrieve
   AUTO_INCREMENT values. First, we demonstrate the use of the new
   JDBC 3.0 method getGeneratedKeys() which is now the preferred
   method to use if you need to retrieve AUTO_INCREMENT keys and have
   access to JDBC 3.0. The second example shows how you can retrieve
   the same value using a standard SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID() query. The
   final example shows how updatable result sets can retrieve the
   AUTO_INCREMENT value when using the insertRow() method.

   Example 6.8 Connector/J: Retrieving AUTO_INCREMENT column values
   using Statement.getGeneratedKeys()
   Statement stmt = null;
   ResultSet rs = null;

   try {

    //
    // Create a Statement instance that we can use for
    // 'normal' result sets assuming you have a
    // Connection 'conn' to a MySQL database already
    // available

    stmt = conn.createStatement(java.sql.ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY,
                                java.sql.ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE);

    //
    // Issue the DDL queries for the table for this example
    //

    stmt.executeUpdate("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS autoIncTutorial");
    stmt.executeUpdate(
            "CREATE TABLE autoIncTutorial ("

            + "priKey INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, "

            + "dataField VARCHAR(64), PRIMARY KEY (priKey))");

    //
    // Insert one row that will generate an AUTO INCREMENT
    // key in the 'priKey' field
    //

    stmt.executeUpdate(
            "INSERT INTO autoIncTutorial (dataField) "

            + "values ('Can I Get the Auto Increment Field?')",
            Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS);

    //
    // Example of using Statement.getGeneratedKeys()
    // to retrieve the value of an auto-increment
    // value
    //

    int autoIncKeyFromApi = -1;

    rs = stmt.getGeneratedKeys();

    if (rs.next()) {
        autoIncKeyFromApi = rs.getInt(1);
    } else {

        // throw an exception from here
    }

    rs.close();

    rs = null;

    System.out.println("Key returned from getGeneratedKeys():"

        + autoIncKeyFromApi);
} finally {

    if (rs != null) {
        try {
            rs.close();
        } catch (SQLException ex) {
            // ignore
        }
    }

    if (stmt != null) {
        try {
            stmt.close();
        } catch (SQLException ex) {
            // ignore
        }
    }
}

   Example 6.9 Connector/J: Retrieving AUTO_INCREMENT column values
   using SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()
   Statement stmt = null;
   ResultSet rs = null;

   try {

    //
    // Create a Statement instance that we can use for
    // 'normal' result sets.

    stmt = conn.createStatement();

    //
    // Issue the DDL queries for the table for this example
    //

    stmt.executeUpdate("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS autoIncTutorial");
    stmt.executeUpdate(
            "CREATE TABLE autoIncTutorial ("

            + "priKey INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, "

            + "dataField VARCHAR(64), PRIMARY KEY (priKey))");

    //
    // Insert one row that will generate an AUTO INCREMENT
    // key in the 'priKey' field
    //

    stmt.executeUpdate(
            "INSERT INTO autoIncTutorial (dataField) "

            + "values ('Can I Get the Auto Increment Field?')");

    //
    // Use the MySQL LAST_INSERT_ID()
    // function to do the same thing as getGeneratedKeys()
    //

    int autoIncKeyFromFunc = -1;
    rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()");

    if (rs.next()) {
        autoIncKeyFromFunc = rs.getInt(1);
    } else {
        // throw an exception from here
    }

    rs.close();

    System.out.println("Key returned from " +
                       "'SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()': " +
                       autoIncKeyFromFunc);

} finally {

    if (rs != null) {
        try {
            rs.close();
        } catch (SQLException ex) {
            // ignore
        }
    }

    if (stmt != null) {
        try {
            stmt.close();
        } catch (SQLException ex) {
            // ignore
        }
    }
}

   Example 6.10 Connector/J: Retrieving AUTO_INCREMENT column values
   in Updatable ResultSets
   Statement stmt = null;
   ResultSet rs = null;

   try {

    //
    // Create a Statement instance that we can use for
    // 'normal' result sets as well as an 'updatable'
    // one, assuming you have a Connection 'conn' to
    // a MySQL database already available
    //

    stmt = conn.createStatement(java.sql.ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY,
                                java.sql.ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE);

    //
    // Issue the DDL queries for the table for this example
    //

    stmt.executeUpdate("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS autoIncTutorial");
    stmt.executeUpdate(
            "CREATE TABLE autoIncTutorial ("

            + "priKey INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, "

            + "dataField VARCHAR(64), PRIMARY KEY (priKey))");

    //
    // Example of retrieving an AUTO INCREMENT key
    // from an updatable result set
    //

    rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT priKey, dataField "

       + "FROM autoIncTutorial");

    rs.moveToInsertRow();

    rs.updateString("dataField", "AUTO INCREMENT here?");
    rs.insertRow();

    //
    // the driver adds rows at the end
    //

    rs.last();

    //
    // We should now be on the row we just inserted
    //

    int autoIncKeyFromRS = rs.getInt("priKey");

    rs.close();

    rs = null;

    System.out.println("Key returned for inserted row: "

        + autoIncKeyFromRS);

} finally {

    if (rs != null) {
        try {
            rs.close();
        } catch (SQLException ex) {
            // ignore
        }
    }

    if (stmt != null) {
        try {
            stmt.close();
        } catch (SQLException ex) {
            // ignore
        }
    }
}

   Running the preceding example code should produce the following
   output:
Key returned from getGeneratedKeys(): 1
Key returned from SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID(): 1
Key returned for inserted row: 2

   At times, it can be tricky to use the SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()
   query, as that function's value is scoped to a connection. So, if
   some other query happens on the same connection, the value is
   overwritten. On the other hand, the getGeneratedKeys() method is
   scoped by the Statement instance, so it can be used even if other
   queries happen on the same connection, but not on the same
   Statement instance.

Chapter 7 Connection Pooling with Connector/J

   Connection pooling is a technique of creating and managing a pool
   of connections that are ready for use by any thread
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/glossary.html#glos_thread)
   that needs them. Connection pooling can greatly increase the
   performance of your Java application, while reducing overall
   resource usage.

How Connection Pooling Works

   Most applications only need a thread to have access to a JDBC
   connection when they are actively processing a transaction
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/glossary.html#glos_transac
   tion), which often takes only milliseconds to complete. When not
   processing a transaction, the connection sits idle. Connection
   pooling enables the idle connection to be used by some other
   thread to do useful work.

   In practice, when a thread needs to do work against a MySQL or
   other database with JDBC, it requests a connection from the pool.
   When the thread is finished using the connection, it returns it to
   the pool, so that it can be used by any other threads.

   When the connection is loaned out from the pool, it is used
   exclusively by the thread that requested it. From a programming
   point of view, it is the same as if your thread called
   DriverManager.getConnection() every time it needed a JDBC
   connection. With connection pooling, your thread may end up using
   either a new connection or an already-existing connection.

Benefits of Connection Pooling

   The main benefits to connection pooling are:

     * Reduced connection creation time.
       Although this is not usually an issue with the quick
       connection setup that MySQL offers compared to other
       databases, creating new JDBC connections still incurs
       networking and JDBC driver overhead that will be avoided if
       connections are recycled.

     * Simplified programming model.
       When using connection pooling, each individual thread can act
       as though it has created its own JDBC connection, allowing you
       to use straightforward JDBC programming techniques.

     * Controlled resource usage.
       If you create a new connection every time a thread needs one,
       rather than using connection pooling, your application's
       resource usage can be wasteful and lead to unpredictable
       behavior under load.

Using Connection Pooling with Connector/J

   Sun has standardized the concept of connection pooling in JDBC
   through the JDBC 2.0 Optional interfaces, and all major
   application servers have implementations of these APIs that work
   with MySQL Connector/J.

   Generally, you configure a connection pool in your application
   server configuration files, and access it through the Java Naming
   and Directory Interface (JNDI). The following code shows how you
   might use a connection pool from an application deployed in a J2EE
   application server:

   Example 7.1 Connector/J: Using a connection pool with a J2EE
   application server
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Statement;

import javax.naming.InitialContext;
import javax.sql.DataSource;


public class MyServletJspOrEjb {

    public void doSomething() throws Exception {
        /*

         * Create a JNDI Initial context to be able to

         *  lookup  the DataSource
         *

         * In production-level code, this should be cached as

         * an instance or static variable, as it can

         * be quite expensive to create a JNDI context.
         *

         * Note: This code only works when you are using servlets

         * or EJBs in a J2EE application server. If you are

         * using connection pooling in standalone Java code, you

         * will have to create/configure datasources using whatever

         * mechanisms your particular connection pooling library

         * provides.
         */

        InitialContext ctx = new InitialContext();

         /*

          * Lookup the DataSource, which will be backed by a pool

          * that the application server provides. DataSource instance
s

          * are also a good candidate for caching as an instance

          * variable, as JNDI lookups can be expensive as well.
          */

        DataSource ds =
          (DataSource)ctx.lookup("java:comp/env/jdbc/MySQLDB");

        /*

         * The following code is what would actually be in your

         * Servlet, JSP or EJB 'service' method...where you need

         * to work with a JDBC connection.
         */

        Connection conn = null;
        Statement stmt = null;

        try {
            conn = ds.getConnection();

            /*

             * Now, use normal JDBC programming to work with

             * MySQL, making sure to close each resource when you're

             * finished with it, which permits the connection pool

             * resources to be recovered as quickly as possible
             */

            stmt = conn.createStatement();
            stmt.execute("SOME SQL QUERY");

            stmt.close();
            stmt = null;

            conn.close();
            conn = null;
        } finally {
            /*

             * close any jdbc instances here that weren't

             * explicitly closed during normal code path, so

             * that we don't 'leak' resources...
             */

            if (stmt != null) {
                try {
                    stmt.close();
                } catch (sqlexception sqlex) {
                    // ignore, as we can't do anything about it here
                }

                stmt = null;
            }

            if (conn != null) {
                try {
                    conn.close();
                } catch (sqlexception sqlex) {
                    // ignore, as we can't do anything about it here
                }

                conn = null;
            }
        }
    }
}

   As shown in the example above, after obtaining the JNDI
   InitialContext, and looking up the DataSource, the rest of the
   code follows familiar JDBC conventions.

   When using connection pooling, always make sure that connections,
   and anything created by them (such as statements or result sets)
   are closed. This rule applies no matter what happens in your code
   (exceptions, flow-of-control, and so forth). When these objects
   are closed, they can be re-used; otherwise, they will be stranded,
   which means that the MySQL server resources they represent (such
   as buffers, locks, or sockets) are tied up for some time, or in
   the worst case can be tied up forever.

Sizing the Connection Pool

   Each connection to MySQL has overhead (memory, CPU, context
   switches, and so forth) on both the client and server side. Every
   connection limits how many resources there are available to your
   application as well as the MySQL server. Many of these resources
   will be used whether or not the connection is actually doing any
   useful work! Connection pools can be tuned to maximize
   performance, while keeping resource utilization below the point
   where your application will start to fail rather than just run
   slower.

   The optimal size for the connection pool depends on anticipated
   load and average database transaction time. In practice, the
   optimal connection pool size can be smaller than you might expect.
   If you take Sun's Java Petstore blueprint application for example,
   a connection pool of 15-20 connections can serve a relatively
   moderate load (600 concurrent users) using MySQL and Tomcat with
   acceptable response times.

   To correctly size a connection pool for your application, create
   load test scripts with tools such as Apache JMeter or The Grinder,
   and load test your application.

   An easy way to determine a starting point is to configure your
   connection pool's maximum number of connections to be unbounded,
   run a load test, and measure the largest amount of concurrently
   used connections. You can then work backward from there to
   determine what values of minimum and maximum pooled connections
   give the best performance for your particular application.

Validating Connections

   MySQL Connector/J can validate the connection by executing a
   lightweight ping against a server. In the case of load-balanced
   connections, this is performed against all active pooled internal
   connections that are retained. This is beneficial to Java
   applications using connection pools, as the pool can use this
   feature to validate connections. Depending on your connection pool
   and configuration, this validation can be carried out at different
   times:

    1. Before the pool returns a connection to the application.

    2. When the application returns a connection to the pool.

    3. During periodic checks of idle connections.

   To use this feature, specify a validation query in your connection
   pool that starts with /* ping */. Note that the syntax must be
   exactly as specified. This will cause the driver send a ping to
   the server and return a dummy lightweight result set. When using a
   ReplicationConnection or LoadBalancedConnection, the ping will be
   sent across all active connections.

   It is critical that the syntax be specified correctly. The syntax
   needs to be exact for reasons of efficiency, as this test is done
   for every statement that is executed:

protected static final String PING_MARKER = "/* ping */";
...
if (sql.charAt(0) == '/') {
if (sql.startsWith(PING_MARKER)) {
doPingInstead();
...

   None of the following snippets will work, because the ping syntax
   is sensitive to whitespace, capitalization, and placement:
sql = "/* PING */ SELECT 1";
sql = "SELECT 1 /* ping*/";
sql = "/*ping*/ SELECT 1";
sql = " /* ping */ SELECT 1";
sql = "/*to ping or not to ping*/ SELECT 1";

   All of the previous statements will issue a normal SELECT
   statement and will not be transformed into the lightweight ping.
   Further, for load-balanced connections, the statement will be
   executed against one connection in the internal pool, rather than
   validating each underlying physical connection. This results in
   the non-active physical connections assuming a stale state, and
   they may die. If Connector/J then re-balances, it might select a
   dead connection, resulting in an exception being passed to the
   application. To help prevent this, you can use
   loadBalanceValidateConnectionOnSwapServer to validate the
   connection before use.

   If your Connector/J deployment uses a connection pool that allows
   you to specify a validation query, take advantage of it, but
   ensure that the query starts exactly with /* ping */. This is
   particularly important if you are using the load-balancing or
   replication-aware features of Connector/J, as it will help keep
   alive connections which otherwise will go stale and die, causing
   problems later.

Chapter 8 Multi-Host Connections

   The following sections discuss a number of topics that involve
   multi-host connections, namely: server load-balancing, fail-over,
   and replication.

   Developers should know the following things about multi-host
   connections that are managed through Connector/J:

     * Each multi-host connection is a wrapper of the underlying
       physical connections.

     * Each of the underlying physical connections has its own
       session. Sessions cannot be tracked, shared, or copied, given
       the MySQL architecture.

     * Every switch between physical connections means a switch
       between sessions.

     * Within a transaction boundary, there are no switches between
       physical connections. Beyond a transaction boundary, there is
       no guarantee that a switch does not occur.
       Note
       If an application reuses session-scope data (for example,
       variables, SSPs) beyond a transaction boundary, failures are
       possible, as a switch between the physical connections (which
       is also a switch between sessions) might occur. Therefore, the
       application should re-prepare the session data and also
       restart the last transaction in case of an exception, or it
       should re-prepare session data for each new transaction if it
       does not want to deal with exception handling.

8.1 Configuring Load Balancing with Connector/J

   Connector/J has long provided an effective means to distribute
   read/write load across multiple MySQL server instances for Cluster
   or master-master replication deployments. Starting with
   Connector/J 5.1.3, you can now dynamically configure load-balanced
   connections, with no service outage. In-process transactions are
   not lost, and no application exceptions are generated if any
   application is trying to use that particular server instance.

   There are two connection string options associated with this
   functionality:

     * loadBalanceConnectionGroup - This provides the ability to
       group connections from different sources. This allows you to
       manage these JDBC sources within a single class loader in any
       combination you choose. If they use the same configuration,
       and you want to manage them as a logical single group, give
       them the same name. This is the key property for management:
       if you do not define a name (string) for
       loadBalanceConnectionGroup, you cannot manage the connections.
       All load-balanced connections sharing the same
       loadBalanceConnectionGroup value, regardless of how the
       application creates them, will be managed together.

     * loadBalanceEnableJMX - The ability to manage the connections
       is exposed when you define a loadBalanceConnectionGroup, but
       if you want to manage this externally, enable JMX by setting
       this property to true. This enables a JMX implementation,
       which exposes the management and monitoring operations of a
       connection group. Further, start your application with the
       -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote JVM flag. You can then perform
       connect and perform operations using a JMX client such as
       jconsole.

   Once a connection has been made using the correct connection
   string options, a number of monitoring properties are available:

     * Current active host count.

     * Current active physical connection count.

     * Current active logical connection count.

     * Total logical connections created.

     * Total transaction count.

   The following management operations can also be performed:

     * Add host.

     * Remove host.

   The JMX interface,
   com.mysql.jdbc.jmx.LoadBalanceConnectionGroupManagerMBean, has the
   following methods:

     * int getActiveHostCount(String group);

     * int getTotalHostCount(String group);

     * long getTotalLogicalConnectionCount(String group);

     * long getActiveLogicalConnectionCount(String group);

     * long getActivePhysicalConnectionCount(String group);

     * long getTotalPhysicalConnectionCount(String group);

     * long getTotalTransactionCount(String group);

     * void removeHost(String group, String host) throws
       SQLException;

     * void stopNewConnectionsToHost(String group, String host)
       throws SQLException;

     * void addHost(String group, String host, boolean forExisting);

     * String getActiveHostsList(String group);

     * String getRegisteredConnectionGroups();

   The getRegisteredConnectionGroups() method returns the names of
   all connection groups defined in that class loader.

   You can test this setup with the following code:

public class Test {

    private static String URL = "jdbc:mysql:loadbalance://" +
        "localhost:3306,localhost:3310/test?" +
        "loadBalanceConnectionGroup=first&loadBalanceEnableJMX=true";

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        new Thread(new Repeater()).start();
        new Thread(new Repeater()).start();
        new Thread(new Repeater()).start();
    }

    static Connection getNewConnection() throws SQLException, ClassNo
tFoundException {
        Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
        return DriverManager.getConnection(URL, "root", "");
    }

    static void executeSimpleTransaction(Connection c, int conn, int
trans){
        try {
            c.setAutoCommit(false);
            Statement s = c.createStatement();
            s.executeQuery("SELECT SLEEP(1) /* Connection: " + conn +
 ", transaction: " + trans + " */");
            c.commit();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public static class Repeater implements Runnable {
        public void run() {
            for(int i=0; i < 100; i++){
                try {
                    Connection c = getNewConnection();
                    for(int j=0; j < 10; j++){
                        executeSimpleTransaction(c, i, j);
                        Thread.sleep(Math.round(100 * Math.random()))
;
                    }
                    c.close();
                    Thread.sleep(100);
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

   After compiling, the application can be started with the
   -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote flag, to enable remote management.
   jconsole can then be started. The Test main class will be listed
   by jconsole. Select this and click Connect. You can then navigate
   to the com.mysql.jdbc.jmx.LoadBalanceConnectionGroupManager bean.
   At this point, you can click on various operations and examine the
   returned result.

   If you now had an additional instance of MySQL running on port
   3309, you could ensure that Connector/J starts using it by using
   the addHost(), which is exposed in jconsole. Note that these
   operations can be performed dynamically without having to stop the
   application running.

   For further information on the combination of load balancing and
   failover, see Section 8.2, "Configuring Failover with
   Connector/J."

8.2 Configuring Failover with Connector/J

   Connector/J provides a useful load-balancing implementation for
   Cluster or multi-master deployments, as explained in Section 8.1,
   "Configuring Load Balancing with Connector/J." As of Connector/J
   5.1.12, this same implementation is used for balancing load
   between read-only slaves with ReplicationDriver. When trying to
   balance workload between multiple servers, the driver has to
   determine when it is safe to swap servers, doing so in the middle
   of a transaction, for example, could cause problems. It is
   important not to lose state information. For this reason,
   Connector/J will only try to pick a new server when one of the
   following happens:

    1. At transaction boundaries (transactions are explicitly
       committed or rolled back).

    2. A communication exception (SQL State starting with "08") is
       encountered.

    3. When a SQLException matches conditions defined by user, using
       the extension points defined by the
       loadBalanceSQLStateFailover,
       loadBalanceSQLExceptionSubclassFailover or
       loadBalanceExceptionChecker properties.

   The third condition revolves around three new properties
   introduced with Connector/J 5.1.13. It allows you to control which
   SQLExceptions trigger failover.

     * loadBalanceExceptionChecker - The loadBalanceExceptionChecker
       property is really the key. This takes a fully-qualified class
       name which implements the new
       com.mysql.jdbc.LoadBalanceExceptionChecker interface. This
       interface is very simple, and you only need to implement the
       following method:
public boolean shouldExceptionTriggerFailover(SQLException ex)
       A SQLException is passed in, and a boolean returned. A value
       of true triggers a failover, false does not.
       You can use this to implement your own custom logic. An
       example where this might be useful is when dealing with
       transient errors when using MySQL Cluster, where certain
       buffers may become overloaded. The following code snippet
       illustrates this:

public class NdbLoadBalanceExceptionChecker
 extends StandardLoadBalanceExceptionChecker {

 public boolean shouldExceptionTriggerFailover(SQLException ex) {
  return super.shouldExceptionTriggerFailover(ex)
    ||  checkNdbException(ex);
 }

 private boolean checkNdbException(SQLException ex){
 // Have to parse the message since most NDB errors
 // are mapped to the same DEMC.
  return (ex.getMessage().startsWith("Lock wait timeout exceeded") ||
  (ex.getMessage().startsWith("Got temporary error")
  && ex.getMessage().endsWith("from NDB")));
 }
}

       The code above extends
       com.mysql.jdbc.StandardLoadBalanceExceptionChecker, which is
       the default implementation. There are a few convenient
       shortcuts built into this, for those who want to have some
       level of control using properties, without writing Java code.
       This default implementation uses the two remaining properties:
       loadBalanceSQLStateFailover and
       loadBalanceSQLExceptionSubclassFailover.

     * loadBalanceSQLStateFailover - allows you to define a
       comma-delimited list of SQLState code prefixes, against which
       a SQLException is compared. If the prefix matches, failover is
       triggered. So, for example, the following would trigger a
       failover if a given SQLException starts with "00", or is
       "12345":
loadBalanceSQLStateFailover=00,12345

     * loadBalanceSQLExceptionSubclassFailover - can be used in
       conjunction with loadBalanceSQLStateFailover or on its own. If
       you want certain subclasses of SQLException to trigger
       failover, simply provide a comma-delimited list of
       fully-qualified class or interface names to check against. For
       example, if you want all SQLTransientConnectionExceptions to
       trigger failover, you would specify:
loadBalanceSQLExceptionSubclassFailover=java.sql.SQLTransientConnecti
onException

   While the three fail-over conditions enumerated earlier suit most
   situations, if autocommit is enabled, Connector/J never
   re-balances, and continues using the same physical connection.
   This can be problematic, particularly when load-balancing is being
   used to distribute read-only load across multiple slaves. However,
   Connector/J can be configured to re-balance after a certain number
   of statements are executed, when autocommit is enabled. This
   functionality is dependent upon the following properties:

     * loadBalanceAutoCommitStatementThreshold - defines the number
       of matching statements which will trigger the driver to
       potentially swap physical server connections. The default
       value, 0, retains the behavior that connections with
       autocommit enabled are never balanced.

     * loadBalanceAutoCommitStatementRegex - the regular expression
       against which statements must match. The default value, blank,
       matches all statements. So, for example, using the following
       properties will cause Connector/J to re-balance after every
       third statement that contains the string "test":
loadBalanceAutoCommitStatementThreshold=3
loadBalanceAutoCommitStatementRegex=.*test.*
       loadBalanceAutoCommitStatementRegex can prove useful in a
       number of situations. Your application may use temporary
       tables, server-side session state variables, or connection
       state, where letting the driver arbitrarily swap physical
       connections before processing is complete could cause data
       loss or other problems. This allows you to identify a trigger
       statement that is only executed when it is safe to swap
       physical connections.

8.3 Master/Slave Replication with ReplicationConnection

   This section describe a number of features of Connector/J's
   support for replication-aware deployments.

Scaling out Read Load by Distributing Read Traffic to Slaves

   Connector/J 3.1.7 and higher includes a variant of the driver that
   will automatically send queries to a read/write master, or a
   failover or round-robin loadbalanced set of slaves based on the
   state of Connection.getReadOnly().

   An application signals that it wants a transaction to be read-only
   by calling Connection.setReadOnly(true), this replication-aware
   connection will use one of the slave connections, which are
   load-balanced per-vm using a round-robin scheme (a given
   connection is sticky to a slave unless that slave is removed from
   service). If you have a write transaction, or if you have a read
   that is time-sensitive (remember, replication in MySQL is
   asynchronous), set the connection to be not read-only, by calling
   Connection.setReadOnly(false) and the driver will ensure that
   further calls are sent to the master MySQL server. The driver
   takes care of propagating the current state of autocommit,
   isolation level, and catalog between all of the connections that
   it uses to accomplish this load balancing functionality.

   To enable this functionality, use the
   com.mysql.jdbc.ReplicationDriver class when configuring your
   application server's connection pool or when creating an instance
   of a JDBC driver for your standalone application. Because it
   accepts the same URL format as the standard MySQL JDBC driver,
   ReplicationDriver does not currently work with
   java.sql.DriverManager-based connection creation unless it is the
   only MySQL JDBC driver registered with the DriverManager .

   Here is a short example of how ReplicationDriver might be used in
   a standalone application:
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.util.Properties;

import com.mysql.jdbc.ReplicationDriver;

public class ReplicationDriverDemo {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    ReplicationDriver driver = new ReplicationDriver();

    Properties props = new Properties();

    // We want this for failover on the slaves
    props.put("autoReconnect", "true");

    // We want to load balance between the slaves
    props.put("roundRobinLoadBalance", "true");

    props.put("user", "foo");
    props.put("password", "bar");

    //
    // Looks like a normal MySQL JDBC url, with a
    // comma-separated list of hosts, the first
    // being the 'master', the rest being any number
    // of slaves that the driver will load balance against
    //

    Connection conn =
        driver.connect("jdbc:mysql:replication://master,slave1,slave2
,slave3/test",
            props);

    //
    // Perform read/write work on the master
    // by setting the read-only flag to "false"
    //

    conn.setReadOnly(false);
    conn.setAutoCommit(false);
    conn.createStatement().executeUpdate("UPDATE some_table ....");
    conn.commit();

    //
    // Now, do a query from a slave, the driver automatically picks o
ne
    // from the list
    //

    conn.setReadOnly(true);

    ResultSet rs =
      conn.createStatement().executeQuery("SELECT a,b FROM alt_table"
);

     .......
  }
}

   Consider investigating the Load Balancing JDBC Pool (lbpool) tool,
   which provides a wrapper around the standard JDBC driver and
   enables you to use DB connection pools that includes checks for
   system failures and uneven load distribution. For more
   information, see Load Balancing JDBC Driver for MySQL
   (mysql-lbpool) (http://code.google.com/p/mysql-lbpool/).

Support for Multiple-Master Replication Topographies

   Since Connector/J 5.1.27, multi-master replication topographies
   are supported. They can be specified using the following host
   definition syntax:
address=(host=hostname)(port=3306)(type=[master|slave])

   The definition described above assumes that the first (and only
   the first) host is the master. Supporting deployments with an
   arbitrary number of masters and slaves requires a different URL
   syntax for specifying different properties for specific hosts,
   which is just an expansion of the legacy URL syntax with the
   property type=[master|slave]; for example:
jdbc:mysql://address=(type=master)(host=master1host),address=(type=ma
ster)(host=master2host),address=(type=slave)(host=slave1host)/db

   Connector/J uses a load-balanced connection internally for
   management of the master connections, which means that
   ReplicationConnection, when configured to use multiple masters,
   exposes the same options to balance load across master hosts as
   described in Section 8.1, "Configuring Load Balancing with
   Connector/J."

   Users may specify the property allowMasterDownConnections=true to
   allow Connection objects to be created even though no master hosts
   are reachable. Such Connection objects report they are read-only,
   and isMasterConnection() returns false for them. The Connection
   tests for available master hosts when
   Connection.setReadOnly(false) is called, throwing an SQLException
   if it cannot establish a connection to a master, or switching to a
   master connection if the host is available.

Live Reconfiguration of Replication Topography

   Since Connector/J 5.1.28, live management of replication host
   (single or multi-master) topographies is also supported. This
   enables users to promote slaves for Java applications without
   requiring an application restart.

   The replication hosts are most effectively managed in the context
   of a replication connection group. A ReplicationConnectionGroup
   class represents a logical grouping of connections which can be
   managed together. There may be one or more such replication
   connection groups in a given Java class loader (there can be an
   application with two different JDBC resources needing to be
   managed independently). This key class exposes host management
   methods for replication connections, and ReplicationConnection
   objects register themselves with the appropriate
   ReplicationConnectionGroup if a value for the new
   replicationConnectionGroup property is specified. The
   ReplicationConnectionGroup object tracks these connections until
   they are closed, and it is used to manipulate the hosts associated
   with these connections.

   Some important methods related to host management include:

     * getMasterHosts(): Returns a collection of strings representing
       the hosts configured as masters

     * getSlaveHosts(): Returns a collection of strings representing
       the hosts configured as slaves

     * addSlaveHost(String host): Adds new host to pool of possible
       slave hosts for selection at start of new read-only workload

     * promoteSlaveToMaster(String host): Removes the host from the
       pool of potential slaves for future read-only processes
       (existing read-only process is allowed to continue to
       completion) and adds the host to the pool of potential master
       hosts

     * removeSlaveHost(String host, boolean closeGently): Removes the
       host (host name match must be exact) from the list of
       configured slaves; if closeGently is false, existing
       connections which have this host as currently active will be
       closed hardly (application should expect exceptions)

     * removeMasterHost(String host, boolean closeGently): Same as
       removeSlaveHost(), but removes the host from the list of
       configured masters

   Some useful management metrics include:

     * getConnectionCountWithHostAsSlave(String host): Returns the
       number of ReplicationConnection objects that have the given
       host configured as a possible slave

     * getConnectionCountWithHostAsMaster(String host): Returns the
       number of ReplicationConnection objects that have the given
       host configured as a possible master

     * getNumberOfSlavesAdded(): Returns the number of times a slave
       host has been dynamically added to the group pool

     * getNumberOfSlavesRemoved(): Returns the number of times a
       slave host has been dynamically removed from the group pool

     * getNumberOfSlavePromotions(): Returns the number of times a
       slave host has been promoted to a master

     * getTotalConnectionCount(): Returns the number of
       ReplicationConnection objects which have been registered with
       this group

     * getActiveConnectionCount(): Returns the number of
       ReplicationConnection objects currently being managed by this
       group

ReplicationConnectionGroupManager

   com.mysql.jdbc.ReplicationConnectionGroupManager provides access
   to the replication connection groups, together with some utility
   methods.

     * getConnectionGroup(String groupName): Returns the
       ReplicationConnectionGroup object matching the groupName
       provided

   The other methods in ReplicationConnectionGroupManager mirror
   those of ReplicationConnectionGroup, except that the first
   argument is a String group name. These methods will operate on all
   matching ReplicationConnectionGroups, which are helpful for
   removing a server from service and have it decommissioned across
   all possible ReplicationConnectionGroups.

   These methods might be useful for in-JVM management of replication
   hosts if an application triggers topography changes. For managing
   host configurations from outside the JVM, JMX can be used.

Using JMX for Managing Replication Hosts

   When Connector/J is started with replicationEnableJMX=true, a JMX
   MBean will be registered, allowing manipulation of replication
   hosts by a JMX client. The MBean interface is defined in
   com.mysql.jdbc.jmx.ReplicationGroupManagerMBean, and leverages the
   ReplicationConnectionGroupManager static methods:
 public abstract void addSlaveHost(String groupFilter, String host) t
hrows SQLException;
 public abstract void removeSlaveHost(String groupFilter, String host
) throws SQLException;
 public abstract void promoteSlaveToMaster(String groupFilter, String
 host) throws SQLException;
 public abstract void removeMasterHost(String groupFilter, String hos
t) throws SQLException;
 public abstract String getMasterHostsList(String group);
 public abstract String getSlaveHostsList(String group);
 public abstract String getRegisteredConnectionGroups();
 public abstract int getActiveMasterHostCount(String group);
 public abstract int getActiveSlaveHostCount(String group);
 public abstract int getSlavePromotionCount(String group);
 public abstract long getTotalLogicalConnectionCount(String group);
 public abstract long getActiveLogicalConnectionCount(String group);

Chapter 9 Using the Connector/J Interceptor Classes

   An interceptor is a software design pattern that provides a
   transparent way to extend or modify some aspect of a program,
   similar to a user exit. No recompiling is required. With
   Connector/J, the interceptors are enabled and disabled by updating
   the connection string to refer to different sets of interceptor
   classes that you instantiate.

   The connection properties that control the interceptors are
   explained in Section 5.1, "Driver/Datasource Class Names, URL
   Syntax and Configuration Properties for Connector/J:"

     * connectionLifecycleInterceptors, where you specify the fully
       qualified names of classes that implement the
       com.mysql.jdbc.ConnectionLifecycleInterceptor interface. In
       these kinds of interceptor classes, you might log events such
       as rollbacks, measure the time between transaction start and
       end, or count events such as calls to setAutoCommit().

     * exceptionInterceptors, where you specify the fully qualified
       names of classes that implement the
       com.mysql.jdbc.ExceptionInterceptor interface. In these kinds
       of interceptor classes, you might add extra diagnostic
       information to exceptions that can have multiple causes or
       indicate a problem with server settings. Because
       exceptionInterceptors classes are only called when handling a
       SQLException thrown from Connector/J code, they can be used
       even in production deployments without substantial performance
       overhead.

     * statementInterceptors, where you specify the fully qualified
       names of classes that implement the
       com.mysql.jdbc.StatementInterceptorV2 interface. In these
       kinds of interceptor classes, you might change or augment the
       processing done by certain kinds of statements, such as
       automatically checking for queried data in a memcached server,
       rewriting slow queries, logging information about statement
       execution, or route requests to remote servers.

Chapter 10 Using Connector/J with Tomcat

   The following instructions are based on the instructions for
   Tomcat-5.x, available at
   http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/jndi-datasource-examples-h
   owto.html which is current at the time this document was written.

   First, install the .jar file that comes with Connector/J in
   $CATALINA_HOME/common/lib so that it is available to all
   applications installed in the container.

   Next, configure the JNDI DataSource by adding a declaration
   resource to $CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml in the context that
   defines your web application:
  <Context ....>

  ...

  <Resource name="jdbc/MySQLDB"
               auth="Container"
               type="javax.sql.DataSource"/>

  <ResourceParams name="jdbc/MySQLDB">
    <parameter>
      <name>factory</name>
      <value>org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSourceFactory</value>
    </parameter>

    <parameter>
      <name>maxActive</name>
      <value>10</value>
    </parameter>

    <parameter>
      <name>maxIdle</name>
      <value>5</value>
    </parameter>

    <parameter>
      <name>validationQuery</name>
      <value>SELECT 1</value>
    </parameter>

    <parameter>
      <name>testOnBorrow</name>
      <value>true</value>
    </parameter>

    <parameter>
      <name>testWhileIdle</name>
      <value>true</value>
    </parameter>

    <parameter>
      <name>timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis</name>
      <value>10000</value>
    </parameter>

    <parameter>
      <name>minEvictableIdleTimeMillis</name>
      <value>60000</value>
    </parameter>

    <parameter>
     <name>username</name>
     <value>someuser</value>
    </parameter>

    <parameter>
     <name>password</name>
     <value>somepass</value>
    </parameter>

    <parameter>
       <name>driverClassName</name>
       <value>com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</value>
    </parameter>

    <parameter>
      <name>url</name>
      <value>jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test</value>
    </parameter>

  </ResourceParams>
</Context>

   Note that Connector/J 5.1.3 introduced a facility whereby, rather
   than use a validationQuery value of SELECT 1, it is possible to
   use validationQuery with a value set to /* ping */. This sends a
   ping to the server which then returns a fake result set. This is a
   lighter weight solution. It also has the advantage that if using
   ReplicationConnection or LoadBalancedConnection type connections,
   the ping will be sent across all active connections. The following
   XML snippet illustrates how to select this option:

<parameter>
 <name>validationQuery</name>
 <value>/* ping */</value>
</parameter>

   Note that /* ping */ has to be specified exactly.

   In general, follow the installation instructions that come with
   your version of Tomcat, as the way you configure datasources in
   Tomcat changes from time to time, and if you use the wrong syntax
   in your XML file, you will most likely end up with an exception
   similar to the following:
Error: java.sql.SQLException: Cannot load JDBC driver class 'null ' S
QL
state: null

   Note that the auto-loading of drivers having the
   META-INF/service/java.sql.Driver class in JDBC 4.0 causes an
   improper undeployment of the Connector/J driver in Tomcat on
   Windows. Namely, the Connector/J jar remains locked. This is an
   initialization problem that is not related to the driver. The
   possible workarounds, if viable, are as follows: use
   "antiResourceLocking=true" as a Tomcat Context attribute, or
   remove the META-INF/ directory.

Chapter 11 Using Connector/J with JBoss

   These instructions cover JBoss-4.x. To make the JDBC driver
   classes available to the application server, copy the .jar file
   that comes with Connector/J to the lib directory for your server
   configuration (which is usually called default). Then, in the same
   configuration directory, in the subdirectory named deploy, create
   a datasource configuration file that ends with -ds.xml, which
   tells JBoss to deploy this file as a JDBC Datasource. The file
   should have the following contents:
<datasources>
    <local-tx-datasource>

        <jndi-name>MySQLDB</jndi-name>
        <connection-url>jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/dbname</connectio
n-url>
        <driver-class>com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</driver-class>
        <user-name>user</user-name>
        <password>pass</password>

        <min-pool-size>5</min-pool-size>

        <max-pool-size>20</max-pool-size>

        <idle-timeout-minutes>5</idle-timeout-minutes>

        <exception-sorter-class-name>
  com.mysql.jdbc.integration.jboss.ExtendedMysqlExceptionSorter
        </exception-sorter-class-name>
        <valid-connection-checker-class-name>
  com.mysql.jdbc.integration.jboss.MysqlValidConnectionChecker
        </valid-connection-checker-class-name>

    </local-tx-datasource>
</datasources>

Chapter 12 Using Connector/J with Spring

   The Spring Framework is a Java-based application framework
   designed for assisting in application design by providing a way to
   configure components. The technique used by Spring is a well known
   design pattern called Dependency Injection (see Inversion of
   Control Containers and the Dependency Injection pattern
   (http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html)). This
   article will focus on Java-oriented access to MySQL databases with
   Spring 2.0. For those wondering, there is a .NET port of Spring
   appropriately named Spring.NET.

   Spring is not only a system for configuring components, but also
   includes support for aspect oriented programming (AOP). This is
   one of the main benefits and the foundation for Spring's resource
   and transaction management. Spring also provides utilities for
   integrating resource management with JDBC and Hibernate.

   For the examples in this section the MySQL world sample database
   will be used. The first task is to set up a MySQL data source
   through Spring. Components within Spring use the "bean"
   terminology. For example, to configure a connection to a MySQL
   server supporting the world sample database, you might use:

<util:map id="dbProps">
    <entry key="db.driver" value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"/>
    <entry key="db.jdbcurl" value="jdbc:mysql://localhost/world"/>
    <entry key="db.username" value="myuser"/>
    <entry key="db.password" value="mypass"/>
</util:map>

   In the above example, we are assigning values to properties that
   will be used in the configuration. For the datasource
   configuration:

<bean id="dataSource"
       class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSo
urce">
    <property name="driverClassName" value="${db.driver}"/>
    <property name="url" value="${db.jdbcurl}"/>
    <property name="username" value="${db.username}"/>
    <property name="password" value="${db.password}"/>
</bean>

   The placeholders are used to provide values for properties of this
   bean. This means that you can specify all the properties of the
   configuration in one place instead of entering the values for each
   property on each bean. We do, however, need one more bean to pull
   this all together. The last bean is responsible for actually
   replacing the placeholders with the property values.

<bean
 class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderC
onfigurer">
    <property name="properties" ref="dbProps"/>
</bean>

   Now that we have our MySQL data source configured and ready to go,
   we write some Java code to access it. The example below will
   retrieve three random cities and their corresponding country using
   the data source we configured with Spring.
// Create a new application context. this processes the Spring config
ApplicationContext ctx =
    new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("ex1appContext.xml");
// Retrieve the data source from the application context
    DataSource ds = (DataSource) ctx.getBean("dataSource");
// Open a database connection using Spring's DataSourceUtils
Connection c = DataSourceUtils.getConnection(ds);
try {
    // retrieve a list of three random cities
    PreparedStatement ps = c.prepareStatement(
        "select City.Name as 'City', Country.Name as 'Country' " +
        "from City inner join Country on City.CountryCode = Country.C
ode " +
        "order by rand() limit 3");
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
    while(rs.next()) {
        String city = rs.getString("City");
        String country = rs.getString("Country");
        System.out.printf("The city %s is in %s%n", city, country);
    }
} catch (SQLException ex) {
    // something has failed and we print a stack trace to analyse the
 error
    ex.printStackTrace();
    // ignore failure closing connection
    try { c.close(); } catch (SQLException e) { }
} finally {
    // properly release our connection
    DataSourceUtils.releaseConnection(c, ds);
}

   This is very similar to normal JDBC access to MySQL with the main
   difference being that we are using DataSourceUtils instead of the
   DriverManager to create the connection.

   While it may seem like a small difference, the implications are
   somewhat far reaching. Spring manages this resource in a way
   similar to a container managed data source in a J2EE application
   server. When a connection is opened, it can be subsequently
   accessed in other parts of the code if it is synchronized with a
   transaction. This makes it possible to treat different parts of
   your application as transactional instead of passing around a
   database connection.

12.1 Using JdbcTemplate

   Spring makes extensive use of the Template method design pattern
   (see Template Method Pattern
   (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern)). Our
   immediate focus will be on the JdbcTemplate and related classes,
   specifically NamedParameterJdbcTemplate. The template classes
   handle obtaining and releasing a connection for data access when
   one is needed.

   The next example shows how to use NamedParameterJdbcTemplate
   inside of a DAO (Data Access Object) class to retrieve a random
   city given a country code.
public class Ex2JdbcDao {
     /**

     * Data source reference which will be provided by Spring.
     */
     private DataSource dataSource;

     /**

     * Our query to find a random city given a country code. Notice

     * the ":country" parameter toward the end. This is called a

     * named parameter.
     */
     private String queryString = "select Name from City " +
        "where CountryCode = :country order by rand() limit 1";

     /**

     * Retrieve a random city using Spring JDBC access classes.
     */
     public String getRandomCityByCountryCode(String cntryCode) {
         // A template that permits using queries with named paramete
rs
         NamedParameterJdbcTemplate template =
         new NamedParameterJdbcTemplate(dataSource);
         // A java.util.Map is used to provide values for the paramet
ers
         Map params = new HashMap();
         params.put("country", cntryCode);
         // We query for an Object and specify what class we are expe
cting
         return (String)template.queryForObject(queryString, params,
String.class);
     }

    /**

    * A JavaBean setter-style method to allow Spring to inject the da
ta source.

    * @param dataSource
    */
    public void setDataSource(DataSource dataSource) {
        this.dataSource = dataSource;
    }
}

   The focus in the above code is on the getRandomCityByCountryCode()
   method. We pass a country code and use the
   NamedParameterJdbcTemplate to query for a city. The country code
   is placed in a Map with the key "country", which is the parameter
   is named in the SQL query.

   To access this code, you need to configure it with Spring by
   providing a reference to the data source.

<bean id="dao" class="code.Ex2JdbcDao">
    <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
</bean>

   At this point, we can just grab a reference to the DAO from Spring
   and call getRandomCityByCountryCode().
    // Create the application context
    ApplicationContext ctx =
    new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("ex2appContext.xml");
    // Obtain a reference to our DAO
    Ex2JdbcDao dao = (Ex2JdbcDao) ctx.getBean("dao");

    String countryCode = "USA";

    // Find a few random cities in the US
    for(int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)
        System.out.printf("A random city in %s is %s%n", countryCode,
            dao.getRandomCityByCountryCode(countryCode));

   This example shows how to use Spring's JDBC classes to completely
   abstract away the use of traditional JDBC classes including
   Connection and PreparedStatement.

12.2 Transactional JDBC Access

   You might be wondering how we can add transactions into our code
   if we do not deal directly with the JDBC classes. Spring provides
   a transaction management package that not only replaces JDBC
   transaction management, but also enables declarative transaction
   management (configuration instead of code).

   To use transactional database access, we will need to change the
   storage engine of the tables in the world database. The downloaded
   script explicitly creates MyISAM tables which do not support
   transactional semantics. The InnoDB storage engine does support
   transactions and this is what we will be using. We can change the
   storage engine with the following statements.
ALTER TABLE City ENGINE=InnoDB;
ALTER TABLE Country ENGINE=InnoDB;
ALTER TABLE CountryLanguage ENGINE=InnoDB;

   A good programming practice emphasized by Spring is separating
   interfaces and implementations. What this means is that we can
   create a Java interface and only use the operations on this
   interface without any internal knowledge of what the actual
   implementation is. We will let Spring manage the implementation
   and with this it will manage the transactions for our
   implementation.

   First you create a simple interface:
public interface Ex3Dao {
    Integer createCity(String name, String countryCode,
    String district, Integer population);
}

   This interface contains one method that will create a new city
   record in the database and return the id of the new record. Next
   you need to create an implementation of this interface.
public class Ex3DaoImpl implements Ex3Dao {
    protected DataSource dataSource;
    protected SqlUpdate updateQuery;
    protected SqlFunction idQuery;

    public Integer createCity(String name, String countryCode,
        String district, Integer population) {
            updateQuery.update(new Object[] { name, countryCode,
                   district, population });
            return getLastId();
        }

    protected Integer getLastId() {
        return idQuery.run();
    }
}

   You can see that we only operate on abstract query objects here
   and do not deal directly with the JDBC API. Also, this is the
   complete implementation. All of our transaction management will be
   dealt with in the configuration. To get the configuration started,
   we need to create the DAO.

<bean id="dao" class="code.Ex3DaoImpl">
    <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
    <property name="updateQuery">...</property>
    <property name="idQuery">...</property>
</bean>

   Now you need to set up the transaction configuration. The first
   thing you must do is create transaction manager to manage the data
   source and a specification of what transaction properties are
   required for the dao methods.

<bean id="transactionManager"
  class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceTransactionMan
ager">
    <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
</bean>

<tx:advice id="txAdvice" transaction-manager="transactionManager">
    <tx:attributes>
        <tx:method name="*"/>
    </tx:attributes>
</tx:advice>

   The preceding code creates a transaction manager that handles
   transactions for the data source provided to it. The txAdvice uses
   this transaction manager and the attributes specify to create a
   transaction for all methods. Finally you need to apply this advice
   with an AOP pointcut.

<aop:config>
    <aop:pointcut id="daoMethods"
        expression="execution(* code.Ex3Dao.*(..))"/>
     <aop:advisor advice-ref="txAdvice" pointcut-ref="daoMethods"/>
</aop:config>

   This basically says that all methods called on the Ex3Dao
   interface will be wrapped in a transaction. To make use of this,
   you only have to retrieve the dao from the application context and
   call a method on the dao instance.
Ex3Dao dao = (Ex3Dao) ctx.getBean("dao");
Integer id = dao.createCity(name,  countryCode, district, pop);

   We can verify from this that there is no transaction management
   happening in our Java code and it is all configured with Spring.
   This is a very powerful notion and regarded as one of the most
   beneficial features of Spring.

12.3 Connection Pooling with Spring

   In many situations, such as web applications, there will be a
   large number of small database transactions. When this is the
   case, it usually makes sense to create a pool of database
   connections available for web requests as needed. Although MySQL
   does not spawn an extra process when a connection is made, there
   is still a small amount of overhead to create and set up the
   connection. Pooling of connections also alleviates problems such
   as collecting large amounts of sockets in the TIME_WAIT state.

   Setting up pooling of MySQL connections with Spring is as simple
   as changing the data source configuration in the application
   context. There are a number of configurations that we can use. The
   first example is based on the Jakarta Commons DBCP library
   (http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/dbcp/). The example below
   replaces the source configuration that was based on
   DriverManagerDataSource with DBCP's BasicDataSource.

<bean id="dataSource" destroy-method="close"
  class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource">
    <property name="driverClassName" value="${db.driver}"/>
    <property name="url" value="${db.jdbcurl}"/>
    <property name="username" value="${db.username}"/>
    <property name="password" value="${db.password}"/>
    <property name="initialSize" value="3"/>
</bean>

   The configuration of the two solutions is very similar. The
   difference is that DBCP will pool connections to the database
   instead of creating a new connection every time one is requested.
   We have also set a parameter here called initialSize. This tells
   DBCP that we want three connections in the pool when it is
   created.

   Another way to configure connection pooling is to configure a data
   source in our J2EE application server. Using JBoss as an example,
   you can set up the MySQL connection pool by creating a file called
   mysql-local-ds.xml and placing it in the server/default/deploy
   directory in JBoss. Once we have this setup, we can use JNDI to
   look it up. With Spring, this lookup is very simple. The data
   source configuration looks like this.

<jee:jndi-lookup id="dataSource" jndi-name="java:MySQL_DS"/>

Chapter 13 Using Connector/J with GlassFish

   This section explains how to use MySQL Connector/J with GlassFish
   (tm) Server Open Source Edition 3.0.1. GlassFish can be downloaded
   from the GlassFish website
   (https://glassfish.dev.java.net/public/downloadsindex.html#top).

   Once GlassFish is installed, make sure it can access MySQL
   Connector/J. To do this, copy the MySQL Connector/J jar file to
   the domain-dir/lib directory. For example, copy
   mysql-connector-java-5.1.30-bin.jar to
   C:\glassfish-install-path\domains\domain-name\lib. Restart the
   GlassFish Application Server. For more information, see
   "Integrating the JDBC Driver" in GlassFish Server Open Source
   Edition Administration Guide, available at GlassFish Server
   Documentation (https://glassfish.java.net/documentation.html).

   You are now ready to create JDBC Connection Pools and JDBC
   Resources.

   Creating a Connection Pool

    1. In the GlassFish Administration Console, using the navigation
       tree navigate to Resources, JDBC, Connection Pools.

    2. In the JDBC Connection Pools frame click New. You will enter a
       two step wizard.

    3. In the Name field under General Settings enter the name for
       the connection pool, for example enter MySQLConnPool.

    4. In the Resource Type field, select javax.sql.DataSource from
       the drop-down listbox.

    5. In the Database Vendor field, select MySQL from the drop-down
       listbox. Click Next to go to the next page of the wizard.

    6. You can accept the default settings for General Settings, Pool
       Settings and Transactions for this example. Scroll down to
       Additional Properties.

    7. In Additional Properties you will need to ensure the following
       properties are set:

          + ServerName - The server to connect to. For local testing
            this will be localhost.

          + User - The user name with which to connect to MySQL.

          + Password - The corresponding password for the user.

          + DatabaseName - The database to connect to, for example
            the sample MySQL database World.

    8. Click Finish to exit the wizard. You will be taken to the JDBC
       Connection Pools page where all current connection pools,
       including the one you just created, will be displayed.

    9. In the JDBC Connection Pools frame click on the connection
       pool you just created. Here, you can review and edit
       information about the connection pool. Because Connector/J
       does not support optimized validation queries, go to the
       Advanced tab, and under Connection Validation, configure the
       following settings:

          + Connection Validation - select Required.

          + Validation Method - select table from the drop-down menu.

          + Table Name - enter DUAL.
   10. To test your connection pool click the Ping button at the top
       of the frame. A message will be displayed confirming correct
       operation or otherwise. If an error message is received
       recheck the previous steps, and ensure that MySQL Connector/J
       has been correctly copied into the previously specified
       location.

   Now that you have created a connection pool you will also need to
   create a JDBC Resource (data source) for use by your application.

   Creating a JDBC Resource

   Your Java application will usually reference a data source object
   to establish a connection with the database. This needs to be
   created first using the following procedure.

     * Using the navigation tree in the GlassFish Administration
       Console, navigate to Resources, JDBC, JDBC Resources. A list
       of resources will be displayed in the JDBC Resources frame.

     * Click New. The New JDBC Resource frame will be displayed.

     * In the JNDI Name field, enter the JNDI name that will be used
       to access this resource, for example enter
       jdbc/MySQLDataSource.

     * In the Pool Name field, select a connection pool you want this
       resource to use from the drop-down listbox.

     * Optionally, you can enter a description into the Description
       field.

     * Additional properties can be added if required.

     * Click OK to create the new JDBC resource. The JDBC Resources
       frame will list all available JDBC Resources.

13.1 A Simple JSP Application with GlassFish, Connector/J and MySQL

   This section shows how to deploy a simple JSP application on
   GlassFish, that connects to a MySQL database.

   This example assumes you have already set up a suitable Connection
   Pool and JDBC Resource, as explained in the preceding sections. It
   is also assumed you have a sample database installed, such as
   world.

   The main application code, index.jsp is presented here:

<%@ page import="java.sql.*, javax.sql.*, java.io.*, javax.naming.*"
%>
<html>
<head><title>Hello world from JSP</title></head>
<body>
<%
  InitialContext ctx;
  DataSource ds;
  Connection conn;
  Statement stmt;
  ResultSet rs;

  try {
    ctx = new InitialContext();
    ds = (DataSource) ctx.lookup("java:comp/env/jdbc/MySQLDataSource"
);
    //ds = (DataSource) ctx.lookup("jdbc/MySQLDataSource");
    conn = ds.getConnection();
    stmt = conn.createStatement();
    rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM Country");

    while(rs.next()) {
%>
    <h3>Name: <%= rs.getString("Name") %></h3>
    <h3>Population: <%= rs.getString("Population") %></h3>
<%
    }
  }
  catch (SQLException se) {
%>
    <%= se.getMessage() %>
<%
  }
  catch (NamingException ne) {
%>
    <%= ne.getMessage() %>
<%
  }
%>
</body>
</html>

   In addition two XML files are required: web.xml, and sun-web.xml.
   There may be other files present, such as classes and images.
   These files are organized into the directory structure as follows:
index.jsp
WEB-INF
   |
   - web.xml
   - sun-web.xml

   The code for web.xml is:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<web-app version="2.4" xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee" xmlns:
xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="h
ttp://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee/web-ap
p_2_4.xsd">
  <display-name>HelloWebApp</display-name>
  <distributable/>
  <resource-ref>
    <res-ref-name>jdbc/MySQLDataSource</res-ref-name>
    <res-type>javax.sql.DataSource</res-type>
    <res-auth>Container</res-auth>
    <res-sharing-scope>Shareable</res-sharing-scope>
  </resource-ref>
</web-app>

   The code for sun-web.xml is:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE sun-web-app PUBLIC "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Applicat
ion Server 8.1 Servlet 2.4//EN" "http://www.sun.com/software/appserve
r/dtds/sun-web-app_2_4-1.dtd">
<sun-web-app>
  <context-root>HelloWebApp</context-root>
  <resource-ref>
    <res-ref-name>jdbc/MySQLDataSource</res-ref-name>
    <jndi-name>jdbc/MySQLDataSource</jndi-name>
  </resource-ref>
</sun-web-app>

   These XML files illustrate a very important aspect of running JDBC
   applications on GlassFish. On GlassFish it is important to map the
   string specified for a JDBC resource to its JNDI name, as set up
   in the GlassFish administration console. In this example, the JNDI
   name for the JDBC resource, as specified in the GlassFish
   Administration console when creating the JDBC Resource, was
   jdbc/MySQLDataSource. This must be mapped to the name given in the
   application. In this example the name specified in the
   application, jdbc/MySQLDataSource, and the JNDI name, happen to be
   the same, but this does not necessarily have to be the case. Note
   that the XML element <res-ref-name> is used to specify the name as
   used in the application source code, and this is mapped to the
   JNDI name specified using the <jndi-name> element, in the file
   sun-web.xml. The resource also has to be created in the web.xml
   file, although the mapping of the resource to a JNDI name takes
   place in the sun-web.xml file.

   If you do not have this mapping set up correctly in the XML files
   you will not be able to lookup the data source using a JNDI lookup
   string such as:
ds = (DataSource) ctx.lookup("java:comp/env/jdbc/MySQLDataSource");

   You will still be able to access the data source directly using:
ds = (DataSource) ctx.lookup("jdbc/MySQLDataSource");

   With the source files in place, in the correct directory
   structure, you are ready to deploy the application:

    1. In the navigation tree, navigate to Applications - the
       Applications frame will be displayed. Click Deploy.

    2. You can now deploy an application packaged into a single WAR
       file from a remote client, or you can choose a packaged file
       or directory that is locally accessible to the server. If you
       are simply testing an application locally you can simply point
       GlassFish at the directory that contains your application,
       without needing to package the application into a WAR file.

    3. Now select the application type from the Type drop-down
       listbox, which in this example is Web application.

    4. Click OK.

   Now, when you navigate to the Applications frame, you will have
   the option to Launch, Redeploy, or Restart your application. You
   can test your application by clicking Launch. The application will
   connection to the MySQL database and display the Name and
   Population of countries in the Country table.

13.2 A Simple Servlet with GlassFish, Connector/J and MySQL

   This section describes a simple servlet that can be used in the
   GlassFish environment to access a MySQL database. As with the
   previous section, this example assumes the sample database world
   is installed.

   The project is set up with the following directory structure:
index.html
WEB-INF
   |
   - web.xml
   - sun-web.xml
   - classes
        |
        - HelloWebServlet.java
        - HelloWebServlet.class

   The code for the servlet, located in HelloWebServlet.java, is as
   follows:

import javax.servlet.http.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import java.io.*;
import java.sql.*;
import javax.sql.*;
import javax.naming.*;

public class HelloWebServlet extends HttpServlet {

  InitialContext ctx = null;
  DataSource ds = null;
  Connection conn = null;
  PreparedStatement ps = null;
  ResultSet rs = null;

  String sql = "SELECT Name, Population FROM Country WHERE Name=?";

  public void init () throws ServletException {
    try {
      ctx = new InitialContext();
      ds = (DataSource) ctx.lookup("java:comp/env/jdbc/MySQLDataSourc
e");
      conn = ds.getConnection();
      ps = conn.prepareStatement(sql);
    }
    catch (SQLException se) {
      System.out.println("SQLException: "+se.getMessage());
    }
    catch (NamingException ne) {
      System.out.println("NamingException: "+ne.getMessage());
    }
  }

  public void destroy () {
    try {
      if (rs != null)
        rs.close();
      if (ps != null)
        ps.close();
      if (conn != null)
        conn.close();
      if (ctx != null)
        ctx.close();
    }
    catch (SQLException se) {
      System.out.println("SQLException: "+se.getMessage());
    }
    catch (NamingException ne) {
      System.out.println("NamingException: "+ne.getMessage());
    }
  }

  public void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp
){
    try {
      String country_name = req.getParameter("country_name");
      resp.setContentType("text/html");
      PrintWriter writer = resp.getWriter();
      writer.println("<html><body>");
      writer.println("<p>Country: "+country_name+"</p>");
      ps.setString(1, country_name);
      rs = ps.executeQuery();
      if (!rs.next()){
        writer.println("<p>Country does not exist!</p>");
      }
      else {
        rs.beforeFirst();
        while(rs.next()) {
          writer.println("<p>Name: "+rs.getString("Name")+"</p>");
          writer.println("<p>Population: "+rs.getString("Population")
+"</p>");
        }
      }
      writer.println("</body></html>");
      writer.close();
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }

  public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)
{
    try {
      resp.setContentType("text/html");
      PrintWriter writer = resp.getWriter();
      writer.println("<html><body>");
      writer.println("<p>Hello from servlet doGet()</p>");
      writer.println("</body></html>");
      writer.close();
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}

   In the preceding code a basic doGet() method is implemented, but
   is not used in the example. The code to establish the connection
   with the database is as shown in the previous example, Section
   13.1, "A Simple JSP Application with GlassFish, Connector/J and
   MySQL," and is most conveniently located in the servlet init()
   method. The corresponding freeing of resources is located in the
   destroy method. The main functionality of the servlet is located
   in the doPost() method. If the user enters nto the input form a
   country name that can be located in the database, the population
   of the country is returned. The code is invoked using a POST
   action associated with the input form. The form is defined in the
   file index.html:

<html>
  <head><title>HelloWebServlet</title></head>

  <body>
    <h1>HelloWebServlet</h1>

    <p>Please enter country name:</p>

    <form action="HelloWebServlet" method="POST">
      <input type="text" name="country_name" length="50" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>

  </body>
</html>

   The XML files web.xml and sun-web.xml are as for the example in
   the preceding section, Section 13.1, "A Simple JSP Application
   with GlassFish, Connector/J and MySQL," no additional changes are
   required.

   Whe compiling the Java source code, you will need to specify the
   path to the file javaee.jar. On Windows, this can be done as
   follows:
shell> javac -classpath c:\glassfishv3\glassfish\lib\javaee.jar Hello
WebServlet.java

   Once the code is correctly located within its directory structure,
   and compiled, the application can be deployed in GlassFish. This
   is done in exactly the same way as described in the preceding
   section, Section 13.1, "A Simple JSP Application with GlassFish,
   Connector/J and MySQL."

   Once deployed the application can be launched from within the
   GlassFish Administration Console. Enter a country name such as
   "England", and the application will return "Country does not
   exist!". Enter "France", and the application will return a
   population of 59225700.

Chapter 14 Using Connector/J with MySQL Fabric

   MySQL Fabric is a system for managing a farm of MySQL servers (and
   other components). Fabric provides an extensible and easy to use
   system for managing a MySQL deployment for sharding and
   high-availability.

   For more information on MySQL Fabric, see MySQL Fabric
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-utilities/1.4/en/fabric.html). For
   instructions on how to use Connector/J with MySQL Fabric, see
   Using Connector/J with MySQL Fabric
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-utilities/1.4/en/connector-j-fabri
   c.html).

Chapter 15 Troubleshooting Connector/J Applications

   This section explains the symptoms and resolutions for the most
   commonly encountered issues with applications using MySQL
   Connector/J.

   Questions

     * 15.1: When I try to connect to the database with MySQL
       Connector/J, I get the following exception:
SQLException: Server configuration denies access to data source
SQLState: 08001
VendorError: 0
       What is going on? I can connect just fine with the MySQL
       command-line client.

     * 15.2: My application throws an SQLException 'No Suitable
       Driver'. Why is this happening?

     * 15.3: I'm trying to use MySQL Connector/J in an applet or
       application and I get an exception similar to:
SQLException: Cannot connect to MySQL server on host:3306.
Is there a MySQL server running on the machine/port you
are trying to connect to?

(java.security.AccessControlException)
SQLState: 08S01
VendorError: 0

     * 15.4: I have a servlet/application that works fine for a day,
       and then stops working overnight

   Questions and Answers

   15.1: When I try to connect to the database with MySQL
   Connector/J, I get the following exception: 
SQLException: Server configuration denies access to data source
SQLState: 08001
VendorError: 0

   What is going on? I can connect just fine with the MySQL
   command-line client. 

   MySQL Connector/J must use TCP/IP sockets to connect to MySQL, as
   Java does not support Unix Domain Sockets. Therefore, when MySQL
   Connector/J connects to MySQL, the security manager in MySQL
   server will use its grant tables to determine whether the
   connection is permitted.

   You must add the necessary security credentials to the MySQL
   server for this to happen, using the GRANT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/grant.html) statement to
   your MySQL Server. See GRANT Syntax
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/grant.html), for more
   information.
   Note

   Testing your connectivity with the mysql command-line client will
   not work unless you add the "host" flag, and use something other
   than localhost for the host. The mysql command-line client will
   use Unix domain sockets if you use the special host name
   localhost. If you are testing connectivity to localhost, use
   127.0.0.1 as the host name instead.
   Warning

   Changing privileges and permissions improperly in MySQL can
   potentially cause your server installation to not have optimal
   security properties.

   15.2: My application throws an SQLException 'No Suitable Driver'.
   Why is this happening? 

   There are three possible causes for this error:

     * The Connector/J driver is not in your CLASSPATH, see Chapter
       3, "Connector/J Installation."

     * The format of your connection URL is incorrect, or you are
       referencing the wrong JDBC driver.

     * When using DriverManager, the jdbc.drivers system property has
       not been populated with the location of the Connector/J
       driver.

   15.3: I'm trying to use MySQL Connector/J in an applet or
   application and I get an exception similar to: 
SQLException: Cannot connect to MySQL server on host:3306.
Is there a MySQL server running on the machine/port you
are trying to connect to?

(java.security.AccessControlException)
SQLState: 08S01
VendorError: 0

   Either you're running an Applet, your MySQL server has been
   installed with the "skip-networking" option set, or your MySQL
   server has a firewall sitting in front of it.

   Applets can only make network connections back to the machine that
   runs the web server that served the .class files for the applet.
   This means that MySQL must run on the same machine (or you must
   have some sort of port re-direction) for this to work. This also
   means that you will not be able to test applets from your local
   file system, you must always deploy them to a web server.

   MySQL Connector/J can only communicate with MySQL using TCP/IP, as
   Java does not support Unix domain sockets. TCP/IP communication
   with MySQL might be affected if MySQL was started with the
   "skip-networking" flag, or if it is firewalled.

   If MySQL has been started with the "skip-networking" option set
   (the Debian Linux package of MySQL server does this for example),
   you need to comment it out in the file /etc/mysql/my.cnf or
   /etc/my.cnf. Of course your my.cnf file might also exist in the
   data directory of your MySQL server, or anywhere else (depending
   on how MySQL was compiled for your system). Binaries created by us
   always look in /etc/my.cnf and datadir/my.cnf. If your MySQL
   server has been firewalled, you will need to have the firewall
   configured to allow TCP/IP connections from the host where your
   Java code is running to the MySQL server on the port that MySQL is
   listening to (by default, 3306).

   15.4: I have a servlet/application that works fine for a day, and
   then stops working overnight 

   MySQL closes connections after 8 hours of inactivity. You either
   need to use a connection pool that handles stale connections or
   use the autoReconnect parameter (see Section 5.1,
   "Driver/Datasource Class Names, URL Syntax and Configuration
   Properties for Connector/J").

   Also, catch SQLExceptions in your application and deal with them,
   rather than propagating them all the way until your application
   exits. This is just good programming practice. MySQL Connector/J
   will set the SQLState (see java.sql.SQLException.getSQLState() in
   your API docs) to 08S01 when it encounters network-connectivity
   issues during the processing of a query. Attempt to reconnect to
   MySQL at this point.

   The following (simplistic) example shows what code that can handle
   these exceptions might look like:

   Example 15.1 Connector/J: Example of transaction with retry logic
public void doBusinessOp() throws SQLException {
    Connection conn = null;
    Statement stmt = null;
    ResultSet rs = null;

    //
    // How many times do you want to retry the transaction
    // (or at least _getting_ a connection)?
    //
    int retryCount = 5;

    boolean transactionCompleted = false;

    do {
        try {
            conn = getConnection(); // assume getting this from a
                                    // javax.sql.DataSource, or the
                                    // java.sql.DriverManager

            conn.setAutoCommit(false);

            //
            // Okay, at this point, the 'retry-ability' of the
            // transaction really depends on your application logic,
            // whether or not you're using autocommit (in this case
            // not), and whether you're using transactional storage
            // engines
            //
            // For this example, we'll assume that it's _not_ safe
            // to retry the entire transaction, so we set retry
            // count to 0 at this point
            //
            // If you were using exclusively transaction-safe tables,
            // or your application could recover from a connection go
ing
            // bad in the middle of an operation, then you would not
            // touch 'retryCount' here, and just let the loop repeat
            // until retryCount == 0.
            //

 {
                retryCount -= 1;
            } else {

            }
        } finally {
            if (rs != null) {
                try {
                    rs.close();
                } catch (SQLException sqlEx) {
                    // You'd probably want to log this...
                }
            }

                } catch (SQLException sqlEx) {
                    //
                    // If we got an exception here, something
                    // pretty serious is going on, so we better
                    // pass it up the stack, rather than just
                    // logging it...

                    throw sqlEx;
                }

        }
    } while (!transactionCompleted && (retryCount > 0));
}

   Note

   Use of the autoReconnect option is not recommended because there
   is no safe method of reconnecting to the MySQL server without
   risking some corruption of the connection state or database state
   information. Instead, use a connection pool, which will enable
   your application to connect to the MySQL server using an available
   connection from the pool. The autoReconnect facility is
   deprecated, and may be removed in a future release.

   15.5: I'm trying to use JDBC 2.0 updatable result sets, and I get
   an exception saying my result set is not updatable. 

   Because MySQL does not have row identifiers, MySQL Connector/J can
   only update result sets that have come from queries on tables that
   have at least one primary key
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/glossary.html#glos_primary
   _key), the query must select every primary key column, and the
   query can only span one table (that is, no joins). This is
   outlined in the JDBC specification.

   Note that this issue only occurs when using updatable result sets,
   and is caused because Connector/J is unable to guarantee that it
   can identify the correct rows within the result set to be updated
   without having a unique reference to each row. There is no
   requirement to have a unique field on a table if you are using
   UPDATE (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/update.html) or
   DELETE (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/delete.html)
   statements on a table where you can individually specify the
   criteria to be matched using a WHERE clause.

   15.6: I cannot connect to the MySQL server using Connector/J, and
   I'm sure the connection parameters are correct. 

   Make sure that the skip-networking
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/server-options.html#option
   _mysqld_skip-networking) option has not been enabled on your
   server. Connector/J must be able to communicate with your server
   over TCP/IP; named sockets are not supported. Also ensure that you
   are not filtering connections through a firewall or other network
   security system. For more information, see Can't connect to
   [local] MySQL server
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/can-not-connect-to-server.
   html).

   15.7: I am trying to connect to my MySQL server within my
   application, but I get the following error and stack trace: 
java.net.SocketException
MESSAGE: Software caused connection abort: recv failed

STACKTRACE:

java.net.SocketException: Software caused connection abort: recv fail

ava:411)

   The error probably indicates that you are using a older version of
   the Connector/J JDBC driver (2.0.14 or 3.0.x) and you are trying
   to connect to a MySQL server with version 4.1x or newer. The older
   drivers are not compatible with 4.1 or newer of MySQL as they do
   not support the newer authentication mechanisms.

   It is likely that the older version of the Connector/J driver
   exists within your application directory or your CLASSPATH
   includes the older Connector/J package.

   15.8: My application is deployed through JBoss and I am using
   transactions to handle the statements on the MySQL database. Under
   heavy loads, I am getting an error and stack trace, but these only
   occur after a fixed period of heavy activity. 

   This is a JBoss, not Connector/J, issue and is connected to the
   use of transactions. Under heavy loads the time taken for
   transactions to complete can increase, and the error is caused
   because you have exceeded the predefined timeout.

   You can increase the timeout value by setting the
   TransactionTimeout attribute to the TransactionManagerService
   within the /conf/jboss-service.xml file (pre-4.0.3) or
   /deploy/jta-service.xml for JBoss 4.0.3 or later. See
   TransactionTimeout
   (http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=TransactionTimeout)
   within the JBoss wiki for more information.

   15.9: When using gcj, a java.io.CharConversionException exception
   is raised when working with certain character sequences. 

   This is a known issue with gcj which raises an exception when it
   reaches an unknown character or one it cannot convert. Add
   useJvmCharsetConverters=true to your connection string to force
   character conversion outside of the gcj libraries, or try a
   different JDK.

   15.10: Updating a table that contains a primary key
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/glossary.html#glos_primary
   _key) that is either FLOAT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/floating-point-types.html)
   or compound primary key that uses FLOAT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/floating-point-types.html)
   fails to update the table and raises an exception. 

   Connector/J adds conditions to the WHERE clause during an UPDATE
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/update.html) to check the
   old values of the primary key. If there is no match, then
   Connector/J considers this a failure condition and raises an
   exception.

   The problem is that rounding differences between supplied values
   and the values stored in the database may mean that the values
   never match, and hence the update fails. The issue will affect all
   queries, not just those from Connector/J.

   To prevent this issue, use a primary key that does not use FLOAT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/floating-point-types.html)
   . If you have to use a floating point column in your primary key,
   use DOUBLE
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/floating-point-types.html)
   or DECIMAL
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/fixed-point-types.html)
   types in place of FLOAT
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/floating-point-types.html)
   .

   15.11: You get an ER_NET_PACKET_TOO_LARGE
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/error-messages-server.html
   #error_er_net_packet_too_large) exception, even though the binary
   blob size you want to insert using JDBC is safely below the
   max_allowed_packet
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/server-system-variables.ht
   ml#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) size. 

   This is because the hexEscapeBlock() method in
   com.mysql.jdbc.PreparedStatement.streamToBytes() may almost double
   the size of your data.

   15.12: What should you do if you receive error messages similar to
   the following: "Communications link failure - Last packet sent to
   the server was X ms ago"? 

   Generally speaking, this error suggests that the network
   connection has been closed. There can be several root causes:

     * Firewalls or routers may clamp down on idle connections (the
       MySQL client/server protocol does not ping).

     * The MySQL Server may be closing idle connections that exceed
       the wait_timeout or interactive_timeout threshold.

   To help troubleshoot these issues, the following tips can be used.
   If a recent (5.1.13+) version of Connector/J is used, you will see
   an improved level of information compared to earlier versions.
   Older versions simply display the last time a packet was sent to
   the server, which is frequently 0 ms ago. This is of limited use,
   as it may be that a packet was just sent, while a packet from the
   server has not been received for several hours. Knowing the period
   of time since Connector/J last received a packet from the server
   is useful information, so if this is not displayed in your
   exception message, it is recommended that you update Connector/J.

   Further, if the time a packet was last sent/received exceeds the
   wait_timeout or interactive_timeout threshold, this is noted in
   the exception message.

   Although network connections can be volatile, the following can be
   helpful in avoiding problems:

     * Ensure connections are valid when used from the connection
       pool. Use a query that starts with /* ping */ to execute a
       lightweight ping instead of full query. Note, the syntax of
       the ping needs to be exactly as specified here.

     * Minimize the duration a connection object is left idle while
       other application logic is executed.

     * Explicitly validate the connection before using it if the
       connection has been left idle for an extended period of time.

     * Ensure that wait_timeout and interactive_timeout are set
       sufficiently high.

     * Ensure that tcpKeepalive is enabled.

     * Ensure that any configurable firewall or router timeout
       settings allow for the maximum expected connection idle time.

   Note

   Do not expect to be able to reuse a connection without problems,
   if it has being lying idle for a period. If a connection is to be
   reused after being idle for any length of time, ensure that you
   explicitly test it before reusing it.

   15.13: Why does Connector/J not reconnect to MySQL and re-issue
   the statement after a communication failure, instead of throwing
   an Exception, even though I use the autoReconnect connection
   string option? 

   There are several reasons for this. The first is transactional
   integrity. The MySQL Reference Manual states that "there is no
   safe method of reconnecting to the MySQL server without risking
   some corruption of the connection state or database state
   information". Consider the following series of statements for
   example:

conn.createStatement().execute(
  "UPDATE checking_account SET balance = balance - 1000.00 WHERE cust
omer='Smith'");
conn.createStatement().execute(
  "UPDATE savings_account SET balance = balance + 1000.00 WHERE custo
mer='Smith'");
conn.commit();

   Consider the case where the connection to the server fails after
   the UPDATE to checking_account. If no exception is thrown, and the
   application never learns about the problem, it will continue
   executing. However, the server did not commit the first
   transaction in this case, so that will get rolled back. But
   execution continues with the next transaction, and increases the
   savings_account balance by 1000. The application did not receive
   an exception, so it continued regardless, eventually committing
   the second transaction, as the commit only applies to the changes
   made in the new connection. Rather than a transfer taking place, a
   deposit was made in this example.

   Note that running with autocommit enabled does not solve this
   problem. When Connector/J encounters a communication problem,
   there is no means to determine whether the server processed the
   currently executing statement or not. The following theoretical
   states are equally possible:

     * The server never received the statement, and therefore no
       related processing occurred on the server.

     * The server received the statement, executed it in full, but
       the response was not received by the client.

   If you are running with autocommit enabled, it is not possible to
   guarantee the state of data on the server when a communication
   exception is encountered. The statement may have reached the
   server, or it may not. All you know is that communication failed
   at some point, before the client received confirmation (or data)
   from the server. This does not only affect autocommit statements
   though. If the communication problem occurred during
   Connection.commit(), the question arises of whether the
   transaction was committed on the server before the communication
   failed, or whether the server received the commit request at all.

   The second reason for the generation of exceptions is that
   transaction-scoped contextual data may be vulnerable, for example:

     * Temporary tables.

     * User-defined variables.

     * Server-side prepared statements.

   These items are lost when a connection fails, and if the
   connection silently reconnects without generating an exception,
   this could be detrimental to the correct execution of your
   application.

   In summary, communication errors generate conditions that may well
   be unsafe for Connector/J to simply ignore by silently
   reconnecting. It is necessary for the application to be notified.
   It is then for the application developer to decide how to proceed
   in the event of connection errors and failures.

   15.14: How can I use 3-byte UTF8 with Connector/J? 

   To use 3-byte UTF8 with Connector/J set characterEncoding=utf8 and
   set useUnicode=true in the connection string.

   15.15: How can I use 4-byte UTF8, utf8mb4 with Connector/J? 

   To use 4-byte UTF8 with Connector/J configure the MySQL server
   with character_set_server=utf8mb4. Connector/J will then use that
   setting as long as characterEncoding has not been set in the
   connection string. This is equivalent to autodetection of the
   character set.

   15.16: Using useServerPrepStmts=false and certain character
   encodings can lead to corruption when inserting BLOBs. How can
   this be avoided? 

   When using certain character encodings, such as SJIS, CP932, and
   BIG5, it is possible that BLOB data contains characters that can
   be interpreted as control characters, for example, backslash, '\'.
   This can lead to corrupted data when inserting BLOBs into the
   database. There are two things that need to be done to avoid this:

    1. Set the connection string option useServerPrepStmts to true.

    2. Set SQL_MODE to NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES.

Chapter 16 Known Issues and Limitations

   The following are some known issues and limitations for MySQL
   Connector/J:

     * When Connector/J retrieves timestamps for a daylight saving
       time (DST) switch day using the getTimeStamp() method on the
       result set, some of the returned values might be wrong. The
       errors can be avoided by using the following connection
       options when connecting to a database:
        useTimezone=true
        useLegacyDatetimeCode=false
        serverTimezone=UTC

17.1 Connector/J Community Support

   Oracle provides assistance to the user community by means of its
   mailing lists. For Connector/J related issues, you can get help
   from experienced users by using the MySQL and Java mailing list.
   Archives and subscription information is available online at
   http://lists.mysql.com/java.

   For information about subscribing to MySQL mailing lists or to
   browse list archives, visit http://lists.mysql.com/. See MySQL
   Mailing Lists
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mailing-lists.html).

   Community support from experienced users is also available through
   the JDBC Forum (http://forums.mysql.com/list.php?39). You may also
   find help from other users in the other MySQL Forums, located at
   http://forums.mysql.com. See MySQL Community Support at the MySQL
   Forums (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/forums.html).

17.2 How to Report Connector/J Bugs or Problems

   The normal place to report bugs is http://bugs.mysql.com/, which
   is the address for our bugs database. This database is public, and
   can be browsed and searched by anyone. If you log in to the
   system, you will also be able to enter new reports.

   If you find a sensitive security bug in MySQL Server, please let
   us know immediately by sending an email message to
   secalert_us@oracle.com. Exception: Support customers should report
   all problems, including security bugs, to Oracle Support at
   http://support.oracle.com/.

   Writing a good bug report takes patience, but doing it right the
   first time saves time both for us and for yourself. A good bug
   report, containing a full test case for the bug, makes it very
   likely that we will fix the bug in the next release.

   This section will help you write your report correctly so that you
   do not waste your time doing things that may not help us much or
   at all.

   If you have a repeatable bug report, please report it to the bugs
   database at http://bugs.mysql.com/. Any bug that we are able to
   repeat has a high chance of being fixed in the next MySQL release.

   To report other problems, you can use one of the MySQL mailing
   lists.

   Remember that it is possible for us to respond to a message
   containing too much information, but not to one containing too
   little. People often omit facts because they think they know the
   cause of a problem and assume that some details do not matter.

   A good principle is this: If you are in doubt about stating
   something, state it. It is faster and less troublesome to write a
   couple more lines in your report than to wait longer for the
   answer if we must ask you to provide information that was missing
   from the initial report.

   The most common errors made in bug reports are (a) not including
   the version number of Connector/J or MySQL used, and (b) not fully
   describing the platform on which Connector/J is installed
   (including the JVM version, and the platform type and version
   number that MySQL itself is installed on).

   This is highly relevant information, and in 99 cases out of 100,
   the bug report is useless without it. Very often we get questions
   like, "Why doesn't this work for me?" Then we find that the
   feature requested wasn't implemented in that MySQL version, or
   that a bug described in a report has already been fixed in newer
   MySQL versions.

   Sometimes the error is platform-dependent; in such cases, it is
   next to impossible for us to fix anything without knowing the
   operating system and the version number of the platform.

   If at all possible, create a repeatable, standalone testcase that
   doesn't involve any third-party classes.

   To streamline this process, we ship a base class for testcases
   with Connector/J, named 'com.mysql.jdbc.util.BaseBugReport'. To
   create a testcase for Connector/J using this class, create your
   own class that inherits from com.mysql.jdbc.util.BaseBugReport and
   override the methods setUp(), tearDown() and runTest().

   In the setUp() method, create code that creates your tables, and
   populates them with any data needed to demonstrate the bug.

   In the runTest() method, create code that demonstrates the bug
   using the tables and data you created in the setUp method.

   In the tearDown() method, drop any tables you created in the
   setUp() method.

   In any of the above three methods, use one of the variants of the
   getConnection() method to create a JDBC connection to MySQL:

     * getConnection() - Provides a connection to the JDBC URL
       specified in getUrl(). If a connection already exists, that
       connection is returned, otherwise a new connection is created.

     * getNewConnection() - Use this if you need to get a new
       connection for your bug report (that is, there is more than
       one connection involved).

     * getConnection(String url) - Returns a connection using the
       given URL.

     * getConnection(String url, Properties props) - Returns a
       connection using the given URL and properties.

   If you need to use a JDBC URL that is different from
   'jdbc:mysql:///test', override the method getUrl() as well.

   Use the assertTrue(boolean expression) and assertTrue(String
   failureMessage, boolean expression) methods to create conditions
   that must be met in your testcase demonstrating the behavior you
   are expecting (vs. the behavior you are observing, which is why
   you are most likely filing a bug report).

   Finally, create a main() method that creates a new instance of
   your testcase, and calls the run method:
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
      new MyBugReport().run();
 }

   Once you have finished your testcase, and have verified that it
   demonstrates the bug you are reporting, upload it with your bug
   report to http://bugs.mysql.com/.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also count
s
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whethe
r
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations bel
ow.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure tha
t
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charg
e
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can ge
t
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender thes
e
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether grati
s
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gav
e
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the sourc
e
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence o
f
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or usin
g
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantage
s
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certai
n
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs
must be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that
a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.
In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library
to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of th
e
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter mus
t
be combined with the library in order to run.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms o
f
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translate
d
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation i
s
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code mean
s
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are no
t
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output fro
m
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work base
d
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.


  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for
a
fee.


  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or
a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that
,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Librar
y
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.


  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Publi
c
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To d
o
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2
,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of th
e
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specif
y
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.


  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, whic
h
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.


  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled o
r
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header fil
e
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivativ
e
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.


  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do on
e
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in th
e
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system
,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2
)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with
.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the abov
e
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you canno
t
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.


  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combine
d
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.


  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies
,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.


  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on th
e
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Librar
y
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any furthe
r
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein
.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties wit
h
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of paten
t
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do no
t
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under thi
s
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence yo
u
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library b
y
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended
to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willin
g
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Librar
y
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published b
y
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free statu
s
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUC
H
DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
of the ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it
does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version
.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Softwa
re
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA
    02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper ma
il.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or yo
ur
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James
  Random Hacker.

A.4 jboss-common-jdbc-wrapper.jar License

   You are receiving a copy of jboss-common-jdbc-wrapper.jar in both
   source and object code in the following
   /src/lib/jboss-common-jdbc-wrapper.jar. The terms of the Oracle
   license do NOT apply to jboss-common-jdbc-wrapper.jar; it is
   licensed under the following license, separately from the Oracle
   programs you receive. If you do not wish to install this library,
   you may remove the file /src/lib/jboss-common-jdbc-wrapper.jar,
   but the Oracle program might not operate properly or at all
   without the library.
